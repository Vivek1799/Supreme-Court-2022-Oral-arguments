       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.</td>\n",

So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off. But I agree with you, Justice Thomas, if that happened, that would fall within the FDA, your hypothetical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time. That is not something the Arizona Supreme Court has ever said anything like before.  It is the essence of novel.  It is the essence of discrimination against decisions of this Court.</td>\n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "3     So, Justice Thomas, that would -- if they changed the label, we do think that it would mean it's not a money order or traveler's check.  So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off.

And we see some parallels because there, there was a note, the time to bring habeas in California was without substantial  delay, so the Court had to wrestle with what was substantial and what was insubstantial, and there was arguments that it wasn't being applied in a -- in a -- in a uniform way. We see a lot of parallels to the significance and insignificance distinction in Rule 32.1(g).  So the court has to be given the opportunity to flesh that out in -- in -- in case -- on a case-by-case determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "216   Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time.

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.</td>\n",

So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off. But I agree with you, Justice Thomas, if that happened, that would fall within the FDA, your hypothetical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time. That is not something the Arizona Supreme Court has ever said anything like before.  It is the essence of novel.  It is the essence of discrimination against decisions of this Court.</td>\n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "3     So, Justice Thomas, that would -- if they changed the label, we do think that it would mean it's not a money order or traveler's check.  So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off.

And we see some parallels because there, there was a note, the time to bring habeas in California was without substantial  delay, so the Court had to wrestle with what was substantial and what was insubstantial, and there was arguments that it wasn't being applied in a -- in a -- in a uniform way. We see a lot of parallels to the significance and insignificance distinction in Rule 32.1(g).  So the court has to be given the opportunity to flesh that out in -- in -- in case -- on a case-by-case determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "216   Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time.

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.</td>\n",

So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off. But I agree with you, Justice Thomas, if that happened, that would fall within the FDA, your hypothetical.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time. That is not something the Arizona Supreme Court has ever said anything like before.  It is the essence of novel.  It is the essence of discrimination against decisions of this Court.</td>\n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "3     So, Justice Thomas, that would -- if they changed the label, we do think that it would mean it's not a money order or traveler's check.  So we do think you look to  the label for that.  And, indeed, I think that's what they say about traveler's checks.  But we don't think it would be true for other similar instruments. So we think that in your hypothetical, in which you have the exact same instrument, but it has just a different name on it, that is an other similar written instrument. Notably, you know, that's never happened, and the reason is because money orders and those labels are important for consumers and for banks.  They want to know what they're getting.  They want to know what they're selling.  And that's why they can't point to a single example where that label has ever been stripped off.

And we see some parallels because there, there was a note, the time to bring habeas in California was without substantial  delay, so the Court had to wrestle with what was substantial and what was insubstantial, and there was arguments that it wasn't being applied in a -- in a -- in a uniform way. We see a lot of parallels to the significance and insignificance distinction in Rule 32.1(g).  So the court has to be given the opportunity to flesh that out in -- in -- in case -- on a case-by-case determination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "216   Thank you.  Four points. First, my friend began by -- began his argument by admitting that there's \"no example\" of what Justice Barrett called a hair-splitting application and interpretation.  He later conceded this was the \"first time\" this interpretation of Rule 32.1 had ever been given. That is the opposite of regularly followed and firmly established every day of the week.  Rule 32 has been around for decades. It's never once been interpreted this way.  It's always been interpreted as overturning precedent.  And you don't need to speculate about this because the Arizona Supreme Court in Rendon had a very similar circumstance, except it involved state law. That was a burglary statute.  The law had always stayed the same. The statute always stayed the same.  What changed was the interpretation of the statute. That court found -- the Supreme -- Arizona Supreme Court said obvious significant change in the law. Lynch works the same way, as Justice Kagan said.  At point A, the law is one thing; at point B, it's another. At point A, 12 different criminal defendants are -- their death sentences are affirmed.  At point B, they should now be reversed under this Court's decision in Lynch. Second, with respect to the question about Stewart versus Smith, Justice Alito, there's no novelty issue at all in that case, no discrimination against federal law issue in that case. That was just about a procedural rule  that just categorized a claim.  It wasn't about applying that law or applying that rule in any way to federal law, which is, I take it, why my friend never even mentioned it during his oral argument. Third, the jury instruction point that he made.  As I said to Justice Gorsuch, as a matter of federal law, it's wrong under Simmons and Lynch, and, also, it's wrong factually. Cruz cited Simmons by name in his trial, Joint Appendix page 54 and 55.  And, also, there's another cert petition pending with six more criminal defendants from Arizona raising the same issue, and his brief in opposition admits that two of them don't even have the jury instruction issue because they sought the jury instruction.  So I think this case is briefed and decided, ready to -- you've got the merits there. And, finally and most importantly, I want to pick up on what Justice Kagan said about the Kafkaesque rule here. It is striking that they still have not explained why they are so resistant to giving Cruz his Simmon rights --Simmons rights, rights that they now say he was  always entitled to.  They're now calling them well-established, but they've been arguing the contrary for decades. In the end, this is about one thing, making sure that Simmons rights aren't extended to Cruz and people like him, even though we know in this very case from the jury foreman it would have made a massive difference. I know this argument gets technical about all this stuff about application of rules and stuff, but here's what the state's saying. In plain English, they're saying that John Cruz should be put to death even though, in fact, because his claim was too good, that it was so powerful, that it was well-established at the time.

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, Justice Barrett, I -- I think that there are a number of ways to conclude that the right-to-control theory is invalid.  Your Honor pointed to one.  It tends to merge different elements, not only materiality, but the way that the Second Circuit has described it, it also subsumes intent to   defraud by collapsing all the -- those elements. It violates core requirements of the statute. It also tends to run aground because it infringes on turf that's covered by Skilling and McNally and would allow the government to prosecute a variety of kinds of things through the guise of calling them property fraud when it cannot do so under honest services. And I'm not saying that the two are hermetically sealed worlds, but the way the government has treated right to control in the Second Circuit, it fills in the blanks where the right -- where the honest services doctrine got cut off by McNally and not reinstated by 1346. So the Court could also say Congress reinstated certain intangible rights in the honest services amendment, Section 1346.  The right to control assets is not one of them. And, therefore, it does not qualify as property for purposes of the property fraud statutes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We'll hear argument next in Case 21-442, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

But this would be a statement that the harm doesn't occur until -- until the time when the opportunity for rehearing has gone by. MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  I -- I think I would say it this way, Your Honor.  I think someone -- I think a prisoner could exit the state court procedures at any point and bring a Section 1983 action at that time and in -- in all likelihood would allow, as -- as -- as I think Your Honor posits, the time for rehearing  to lapse. And I think that would be okay.  There would be harm at that point.  The -- the --there would be a cause of action at that point.

       "      <td>Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I think Morris is not an unconstitutional conditions case.  It's a preemption case.  It's an early example of so-called objectives and purposes or obstacles preemption. What Morris was doing was it was interpreting Section 12 of the First Judiciary Act of 1789, where Congress said, if you're a defendant, you can remove if there's $500 in controversy and there's diversity. And what the Court essentially said in Morris is that's both a floor and a ceiling, sort of a situation like Gier. And so any restraint on someone's ability to remove where those two conditions are satisfied is a violation of the Constitution because of Article VI, Clause 2, the Supremacy Clause.  Here is proof, I think, that that is   correct.  Go through the following thought experiment. Imagine that the First Judiciary Act of 1789 had said you can remove if there's $500 in controversy or diversity, unless you've struck a deal through a registration statute with Wisconsin not to remove, in which case you can't remove. I think there's little doubt that this Court would not have said Congress is not allowed to restrict a defendant's right to removal in that way.  You don't have to go to the full limits of Article III diversity jurisdiction.  We know that because of the amount in controversy requirement.  We know that because of Strawbridge versus Curtiss.  Congress regularly amends the situations to limit the amount of Article III jurisdiction that would otherwise exist if you went all the way to what Article III countenances. So I don't think that Morris can properly be categorized as a true unconstitutional conditions case.  And there are other clues of that in the opinion.  The opinion says that you can't agree by contract to go to  arbitration instead of court. This Court has applied the Federal Arbitration Act many times, so that's obviously been abrogated.  The opinion says you can't agree by contract to waive your right to a jury of 12 men. That has obviously been abrogated in a lot of different ways. So I don't think that Morris is actually an unconstitutional conditions case in the procedural realm.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation.  This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of --of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut  the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1).  Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling.  Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the   Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply. And with that, I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that that is the correct characterization of 5110.  It is true there are exceptions.  As I mentioned, there's exceptions rolled in throughout different Congresses and they -- they get codified in Section 5110. The -- the fact that it says specifically, that's a word of emphasis, as this   Court has held.  Most statutes of limitations are written with words of emphasis, things like shall be forever barred, and as this Court found in Kwai Fun Wong, that's of no moment to whether or not equitable tolling can apply to that statute of limitations. I think the key here is that each one of these benefits is discrete.  A -- a disability -- a service-connected disability compensation is a very different type of benefit than a -- than a disability pension. They're awarded at different times in the veteran's life and one of them is means tested, the pension is means tested, whereas a disability compensation claim is not means tested. A disability pension doesn't even require a showing of service connection. So they're very different types of benefits.  And so, for each one of these unique types of benefits, Congress has established a -- a pathway for retroactive claiming that wouldn't otherwise exist under -- under the general rule, (a)(1), and has set forth basically a statute of limitations saying, if you -- if you want to benefit from this retroactive pathway, you have  to file your claim within a certain period of time. So it very much operates like a statute of limitations.</td>\n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.   \n",
       "46    Well, Justice Barrett, I -- I think that there are a number of ways to conclude that the right-to-control theory is invalid.  Your Honor pointed to one.  It tends to merge different elements, not only materiality, but the way that the Second Circuit has described it, it also subsumes intent to   defraud by collapsing all the -- those elements. It violates core requirements of the statute. It also tends to run aground because it infringes on turf that's covered by Skilling and McNally and would allow the government to prosecute a variety of kinds of things through the guise of calling them property fraud when it cannot do so under honest services. And I'm not saying that the two are hermetically sealed worlds, but the way the government has treated right to control in the Second Circuit, it fills in the blanks where the right -- where the honest services doctrine got cut off by McNally and not reinstated by 1346. So the Court could also say Congress reinstated certain intangible rights in the honest services amendment, Section 1346.  The right to control assets is not one of them. And, therefore, it does not qualify as property for purposes of the property fraud statutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "0     We'll hear argument next in Case 21-442, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "17     Well, an exhaustion requirement is just a requirement that says, even once you've suffered harm, you have to go through certain processes rather than bring suit. But this would be a statement that the harm doesn't occur until -- until the time when the opportunity for rehearing has gone by. MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  I -- I think I would say it this way, Your Honor.  I think someone -- I think a prisoner could exit the state court procedures at any point and bring a Section 1983 action at that time and in -- in all likelihood would allow, as -- as -- as I think Your Honor posits, the time for rehearing  to lapse. And I think that would be okay.  There would be harm at that point.  The -- the --there would be a cause of action at that point.

       "35     Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.                                        \n",

       "24    Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I think Morris is not an unconstitutional conditions case.  It's a preemption case.  It's an early example of so-called objectives and purposes or obstacles preemption. What Morris was doing was it was interpreting Section 12 of the First Judiciary Act of 1789, where Congress said, if you're a defendant, you can remove if there's $500 in controversy and there's diversity. And what the Court essentially said in Morris is that's both a floor and a ceiling, sort of a situation like Gier. And so any restraint on someone's ability to remove where those two conditions are satisfied is a violation of the Constitution because of Article VI, Clause 2, the Supremacy Clause.  Here is proof, I think, that that is   correct.  Go through the following thought experiment. Imagine that the First Judiciary Act of 1789 had said you can remove if there's $500 in controversy or diversity, unless you've struck a deal through a registration statute with Wisconsin not to remove, in which case you can't remove. I think there's little doubt that this Court would not have said Congress is not allowed to restrict a defendant's right to removal in that way.  You don't have to go to the full limits of Article III diversity jurisdiction.  We know that because of the amount in controversy requirement.  We know that because of Strawbridge versus Curtiss.  Congress regularly amends the situations to limit the amount of Article III jurisdiction that would otherwise exist if you went all the way to what Article III countenances. So I don't think that Morris can properly be categorized as a true unconstitutional conditions case.  And there are other clues of that in the opinion.  The opinion says that you can't agree by contract to go to  arbitration instead of court. This Court has applied the Federal Arbitration Act many times, so that's obviously been abrogated.  The opinion says you can't agree by contract to waive your right to a jury of 12 men. That has obviously been abrogated in a lot of different ways.

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation.  This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of --of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut  the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1).  Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling.  Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the   Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply. And with that, I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "19    Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that that is the correct characterization of 5110.  It is true there are exceptions.  As I mentioned, there's exceptions rolled in throughout different Congresses and they -- they get codified in Section 5110. The -- the fact that it says specifically, that's a word of emphasis, as this   Court has held.  Most statutes of limitations are written with words of emphasis, things like shall be forever barred, and as this Court found in Kwai Fun Wong, that's of no moment to whether or not equitable tolling can apply to that statute of limitations. I think the key here is that each one of these benefits is discrete.  A -- a disability -- a service-connected disability compensation is a very different type of benefit than a -- than a disability pension. They're awarded at different times in the veteran's life and one of them is means tested, the pension is means tested, whereas a disability compensation claim is not means tested. A disability pension doesn't even require a showing of service connection. So they're very different types of benefits.  And so, for each one of these unique types of benefits, Congress has established a -- a pathway for retroactive claiming that wouldn't otherwise exist under -- under the general rule, (a)(1), and has set forth basically a statute of limitations saying, if you -- if you want to benefit from this retroactive pathway, you have  to file your claim within a certain period of time. So it very much operates like a statute of limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.</td>\n",

It tends to merge different elements, not only materiality, but the way that the Second Circuit has described it, it also subsumes intent to   defraud by collapsing all the -- those elements. It violates core requirements of the statute. It also tends to run aground because it infringes on turf that's covered by Skilling and McNally and would allow the government to prosecute a variety of kinds of things through the guise of calling them property fraud when it cannot do so under honest services. And I'm not saying that the two are hermetically sealed worlds, but the way the government has treated right to control in the Second Circuit, it fills in the blanks where the right -- where the honest services doctrine got cut off by McNally and not reinstated by 1346. So the Court could also say Congress reinstated certain intangible rights in the honest services amendment, Section 1346.  The right to control assets is not one of them. And, therefore, it does not qualify as property for purposes of the property fraud statutes.</td>\n",

RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.</td>\n",

So, on the  merits, it was very clarifying to me in your exchanges with Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan that you said you're not challenging the removal determination, that you're saying this is really about detention, as the statute says, and that you're interpreting Section 1226(c) to require the detention of certain criminal non-citizens before DHS decides to initiate removal proceedings.

       "      <td>Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I think Morris is not an unconstitutional conditions case.  It's a preemption case.  It's an early example of so-called objectives and purposes or obstacles preemption. What Morris was doing was it was interpreting Section 12 of the First Judiciary Act of 1789, where Congress said, if you're a defendant, you can remove if there's $500 in controversy and there's diversity. And what the Court essentially said in Morris is that's both a floor and a ceiling, sort of a situation like Gier. And so any restraint on someone's ability to remove where those two conditions are satisfied is a violation of the Constitution because of Article VI, Clause 2, the Supremacy Clause.  Here is proof, I think, that that is   correct.  Go through the following thought experiment. Imagine that the First Judiciary Act of 1789 had said you can remove if there's $500 in controversy or diversity, unless you've struck a deal through a registration statute with Wisconsin not to remove, in which case you can't remove. I think there's little doubt that this Court would not have said Congress is not allowed to restrict a defendant's right to removal in that way.  You don't have to go to the full limits of Article III diversity jurisdiction.  We know that because of the amount in controversy requirement.  We know that because of Strawbridge versus Curtiss.  Congress regularly amends the situations to limit the amount of Article III jurisdiction that would otherwise exist if you went all the way to what Article III countenances. So I don't think that Morris can properly be categorized as a true unconstitutional conditions case.  And there are other clues of that in the opinion.  The opinion says that you can't agree by contract to go to  arbitration instead of court. This Court has applied the Federal Arbitration Act many times, so that's obviously been abrogated.  The opinion says you can't agree by contract to waive your right to a jury of 12 men. That has obviously been abrogated in a lot of different ways. So I don't think that Morris is actually an unconstitutional conditions case in the procedural realm.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation.  This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of --of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut  the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1).  Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling.  Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the   Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply. And with that, I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that that is the correct characterization of 5110.  It is true there are exceptions.  As I mentioned, there's exceptions rolled in throughout different Congresses and they -- they get codified in Section 5110. The -- the fact that it says specifically, that's a word of emphasis, as this   Court has held.  Most statutes of limitations are written with words of emphasis, things like shall be forever barred, and as this Court found in Kwai Fun Wong, that's of no moment to whether or not equitable tolling can apply to that statute of limitations. I think the key here is that each one of these benefits is discrete.  A -- a disability -- a service-connected disability compensation is a very different type of benefit than a -- than a disability pension. They're awarded at different times in the veteran's life and one of them is means tested, the pension is means tested, whereas a disability compensation claim is not means tested. A disability pension doesn't even require a showing of service connection. So they're very different types of benefits.  And so, for each one of these unique types of benefits, Congress has established a -- a pathway for retroactive claiming that wouldn't otherwise exist under -- under the general rule, (a)(1), and has set forth basically a statute of limitations saying, if you -- if you want to benefit from this retroactive pathway, you have  to file your claim within a certain period of time. So it very much operates like a statute of limitations.</td>\n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns a piece of statutory text from 1974 in Section 2503, which is found in the blue brief appendix at page 2a. That provision exempts from the common law a narrow set of instruments, a money order, traveler's check, or other similar written instrument other than a third-party bank check. The question today is whether two products, MoneyGram agent checks and MoneyGram teller's checks, fall within that exemption. For many years, the defendant states answered that question \"no.\"  However, after engaging some creative consultants, they changed their mind. They were right the first time for  four separate reasons.  First, when Congress adopted that language in 1974, the term \"money order\" referred to specific commercial products labeled \"money order\" and typically sold to unbanked consumers to pay small debts.  Neither of those apply to the two disputed instruments here. They're not labeled \"money order,\" and they are sold to consumers with bank accounts who are transferring larger sums of money. Second, the FDA was a surgical fix to this Court's 1972 decision with a key purpose behind it, to prevent the price of small-dollar instruments from increasing due to address collection requirements that states might adopt in reaction to this Court's 1972 decision.  That rationale does not apply here, and the two instruments are outside of the FDA altogether. Third, even if you thought these products were within the FDA, the two instruments here fall within the third-party bank check exception.  Like all bank checks, they are signed by bank employees, not purchasers. And, fourth, while we believe that our reading is the best reading of the FDA's text,  structure, and purpose, we don't deny one could read the statute differently, but importantly, if you found things in equipoise, two things would independently break any tie for us. One is the doctrine of reading statutes to avoid derogation of the common law, and the other is this Court's repeated emphasis on the need for bright-line rules and predictability in this space. The defendants' interpretation would upend all that, as their own amici acknowledge. Our view of the statute, by contrast, is predictable, reflects longstanding practice, and provides a bright line for the escheatment of financial products in the future.   \n",
       "46    Well, Justice Barrett, I -- I think that there are a number of ways to conclude that the right-to-control theory is invalid.  Your Honor pointed to one.  It tends to merge different elements, not only materiality, but the way that the Second Circuit has described it, it also subsumes intent to   defraud by collapsing all the -- those elements. It violates core requirements of the statute. It also tends to run aground because it infringes on turf that's covered by Skilling and McNally and would allow the government to prosecute a variety of kinds of things through the guise of calling them property fraud when it cannot do so under honest services. And I'm not saying that the two are hermetically sealed worlds, but the way the government has treated right to control in the Second Circuit, it fills in the blanks where the right -- where the honest services doctrine got cut off by McNally and not reinstated by 1346. So the Court could also say Congress reinstated certain intangible rights in the honest services amendment, Section 1346.  The right to control assets is not one of them. And, therefore, it does not qualify as property for purposes of the property fraud statutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "0     We'll hear argument next in Case 21-442, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "17     Well, an exhaustion requirement is just a requirement that says, even once you've suffered harm, you have to go through certain processes rather than bring suit.

RIDER-LONGMAID:  I -- I think I would say it this way, Your Honor.  I think someone -- I think a prisoner could exit the state court procedures at any point and bring a Section 1983 action at that time and in -- in all likelihood would allow, as -- as -- as I think Your Honor posits, the time for rehearing  to lapse. And I think that would be okay.  There would be harm at that point.  The -- the --there would be a cause of action at that point.

       "35     Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.                                        \n",

Am I right about that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "24    Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I think Morris is not an unconstitutional conditions case.  It's a preemption case.  It's an early example of so-called objectives and purposes or obstacles preemption. What Morris was doing was it was interpreting Section 12 of the First Judiciary Act of 1789, where Congress said, if you're a defendant, you can remove if there's $500 in controversy and there's diversity. And what the Court essentially said in Morris is that's both a floor and a ceiling, sort of a situation like Gier. And so any restraint on someone's ability to remove where those two conditions are satisfied is a violation of the Constitution because of Article VI, Clause 2, the Supremacy Clause.  Here is proof, I think, that that is   correct.  Go through the following thought experiment. Imagine that the First Judiciary Act of 1789 had said you can remove if there's $500 in controversy or diversity, unless you've struck a deal through a registration statute with Wisconsin not to remove, in which case you can't remove. I think there's little doubt that this Court would not have said Congress is not allowed to restrict a defendant's right to removal in that way.  You don't have to go to the full limits of Article III diversity jurisdiction.  We know that because of the amount in controversy requirement.  We know that because of Strawbridge versus Curtiss.  Congress regularly amends the situations to limit the amount of Article III jurisdiction that would otherwise exist if you went all the way to what Article III countenances. So I don't think that Morris can properly be categorized as a true unconstitutional conditions case.  And there are other clues of that in the opinion.  The opinion says that you can't agree by contract to go to  arbitration instead of court. This Court has applied the Federal Arbitration Act many times, so that's obviously been abrogated.  The opinion says you can't agree by contract to waive your right to a jury of 12 men. That has obviously been abrogated in a lot of different ways. So I don't think that Morris is actually an unconstitutional conditions case in the procedural realm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When service-disabled veterans are discharged from the military, they have one year under 5110(b)(1) to file a claim for retroactive disability compensation.  This deadline operates like a statute of limitations by encouraging service-disabled veterans to promptly apply for -- for retroactive benefits or else lose that right forever. The Irwin presumption in favor of --of equitable tolling applies to this one-year deadline because it's a non-jurisdictional claims-processing rule set forth in a statute for which Congress has waived sovereign immunity. Now the Secretary attempts to rebut  the Irwin presumption by characterizing Section 5110 as a general rule subject to multiple exceptions, but that does not rebut the presumption. First, none of the other subsections the Secretary points to relate to service-connected disability compensation, which is the sole focus of 5110(b)(1). For example, the Secretary relies heavily on subsection (b)(4), but that sets a deadline for disability pensions, a different type of benefit passed by a different Congress at a different time. Other subsections set forth deadlines for dependency benefits, death benefits, and death pensions, none of which have any nexus to 5110(b)(1).  Not one of those other deadlines would be rendered superfluous by the application of equitable tolling to 5110(b)(1). So this is not a situation where the deadline in question already includes an exception, an express exception, that would be swallowed by the application of equitable tolling.  Here, there are zero express exceptions to the one-year deadline of 5110(b)(1). Finally, even if we accept the   Secretary's argument that Congress provided equitable exceptions elsewhere in 5110, that only strengthens the Irwin presumption for 5110(b)(1) because, unlike in those other subsections, Congress chose to remain silent for 5110(b)(1), which is exactly what we would expect Congress to do if they -- if it wanted the general rule of equitable tolling to apply. And with that, I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "19    Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree that that is the correct characterization of 5110.  It is true there are exceptions.  As I mentioned, there's exceptions rolled in throughout different Congresses and they -- they get codified in Section 5110. The -- the fact that it says specifically, that's a word of emphasis, as this   Court has held.  Most statutes of limitations are written with words of emphasis, things like shall be forever barred, and as this Court found in Kwai Fun Wong, that's of no moment to whether or not equitable tolling can apply to that statute of limitations. I think the key here is that each one of these benefits is discrete.  A -- a disability -- a service-connected disability compensation is a very different type of benefit than a -- than a disability pension. They're awarded at different times in the veteran's life and one of them is means tested, the pension is means tested, whereas a disability compensation claim is not means tested. A disability pension doesn't even require a showing of service connection. So they're very different types of benefits.  And so, for each one of these unique types of benefits, Congress has established a -- a pathway for retroactive claiming that wouldn't otherwise exist under -- under the general rule, (a)(1), and has set forth basically a statute of limitations saying, if you -- if you want to benefit from this retroactive pathway, you have  to file your claim within a certain period of time. So it very much operates like a statute of limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama conducted its 2021 redistricting in a lawful, race-neutral manner. The state largely retained its existing districts and made changes needed to equalize population.  But that wasn't good enough for the plaintiffs. They argue that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to replace its map with a racially gerrymandered plan maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. But Section 2 requires an electoral process equally open to all, not one that guarantees maximum political success for some over others.  Section 2 does not and cannot  obligate Alabama to abandon district lines enveloping the undisputed longstanding community of interest in the Gulf to be replaced by district lines dividing black and white with such racial precision that Alabama could never have constitutionally drawn those lines in the first place. Yet, that is what Alabama has been commanded to do here:  redraw its districts to subordinate traditional districting principles to race.  The only way to add a second majority-minority district to Alabama's plan is to make race the non-negotiable criterion. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans prove the point. They offer only one way to get that second majority-black district:  split Mobile County and divide the Gulf by race. Their new versions of Districts 1 and 2 then stretch the width of the state to group together black voters from disparate areas as far west as Mobile and as far east as the Georgia border. The District Court relied on these outlier plans to invalidate the state's neutrally drawn map, and that was legal error. Requiring states to scrap neutral plans in favor  of plans drawn on account of race set Section 2 at war with itself and with the Constitution. The Court should make clear that if a state's plan is the product of the state's neutral districting principles, the plan is equally open to all voters.  Because Alabama's 2021 plan is such a plan, Plaintiffs' claims fail. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

Well, we've got phenomenal evidence that they brought forward, and this was another  fact I need to clear up because the United States and both sets of plaintiffs got it wrong in their briefs. But Dr. Imai, he was their --he was the Milligan plaintiffs' expert who was working with the 2020 data. And he drew 10,000 -- three sets of 10,000 maps.  The third set guaranteed one majority black district of 50 to 51 percent, razor thin, leaving as many black voters as possible to find in the other six districts and form a second majority-minority district, then contiguity equal population, keep counties together, stay relatively compact, don't pair incumbents and then prioritize communities of interest. And they've said again and again that he didn't take into account communities of interest.  That is flatly wrong. He did.  And so what he was told to do by the Milligan plaintiffs was to prioritize putting the Gulf counties together and prioritize putting the 23 Black Belt counties together. When he did that, he had one majority black district that was preprogrammed, and then the second highest BVAP district averaged about  36 percent.</td>\n",

They treated race as a traditional districting   principle.  It's going to have that hydraulic effect and it's going to make it harder to comport with traditional districting principles and you're going to end up with a map that's not going to do as well. Also, I mean, intent is not irrelevant.  If we've shown conclusively that we're achieving our legitimate goals, that has to factor in. I think even the dissent in Brnovich said a Section 2 plaintiff needs to show that it's not possible for the state to achieve its legitimate goals in some way. And -- and it's -- we've shown that. It is impossible for us to achieve undisputably legitimate goals of keeping the Gulf together, of maintaining our preexisting district lines in a large amount, and keeping relatively compact districts that someone could look at from Alabama and recognize why they were drawn that way without looking and seeing the price.</td>\n",

I mean, it's textbook predominance. We could have never drawn those maps constitutionally.  And, again, just to get back to, like, the general confusion here, it puts us in an obvious rock and a hard place.  They're using maps we could have never drawn to force us to draw maps that, like, again, we couldn't have ever drawn. So that cannot be how the equal openness mandate of Section 2 works.

It's one of the great achievements of American democracy to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as -- as -- as white Americans could.  That's a pretty big deal. And it was strengthened, this statute, in 1982 when this Court interpreted it too narrowly for Congress's taste, and Congress said no, we didn't mean that at all and made this into a results test. Now, in recent years, this statute has fared not well in this Court.  Shelby County looks at Section 5 and it says no, Section 5, we don't need that anymore, and one of the things it says is we have Section 2. And then Brnovich comes along, and that's a Section 2 case, and the Court says: You know what, Section 2, they're really   dilution claims.  You know, this is a denial claim, and -- and so we can construe that very narrowly.  But, of course, there's just all these cases that are dilution claims.  That's really what Section 2 is about. And now here we are, Section 2 is a dilution claim, this -- you know, the classic Section 2 dilution claim.

We had the second highest black registration in the country, second only to Mississippi.  So I think we need to not lose sight of that. In terms of what Section 2 is supposed to be doing, I think the problem here is we're kind of in like a third generation of vote dilution claims.  You have the multi-member   districts is generation 1. Generation 2 was getting rid of the racial gerrymanders. But generation 3 is let's impose the racial gerrymanders, which I don't think Section 2 was ever designed to do.

Georgia at that time, just like Alabama today, was 27 percent black population. And the judge was trying to comply with Section 2, including this compactness inquiry, and so he said let's look at the traditional districting principles of the state.

I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way.  That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that \"unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen.\" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy.  And -- and even more than that, I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right?  They drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which specifically stated that citizens would have the  same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That's the point of that Act, to make sure that the other citizens, the black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens. So they recognized that there was unequal treatment, that people, based on their race, were being treated unequally. And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn't have a constitutional foundation, that's when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play.  It was drafted to give a foundational -- a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens. So with that as the framing and the background, I'm trying to understand your position that Section 2, which by its plain text is doing that same thing, is saying you need to identify people in this community who have less opportunity and less ability to participate and ensure that that's remedied, right?  It's a race-conscious effort, as you have indicated. I'm trying to understand why that violates the   Fourteenth Amendment, given the history and --and background of the Fourteenth Amendment?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is nothing race-neutral about Alabama's map.  The district court's unanimous and thorough intensely local analysis did not err in finding that the Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance.  Yet, Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white block voting to deny black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs. Rather than argue clear error, Alabama asks us to ignore statutory stare decisis and to rewrite Section 2's text.  But the Voting Rights Act is a remedial statute that Congress has twice reenacted since Gingles, and its application here raises no constitutional concerns. That is because Plaintiffs' maps show, consistent with Bartlett, that it is possible to draw maps that look very similar to Alabama's own Board of Education map and that increase   opportunities for minority voters, while satisfying traditional and state redistricting criteria at least as well as Alabama's map. Nothing in the text of Section 2 allows Alabama to avoid liability by offering up these post hoc rationalizations of simulations and core retention for maps that result in discrimination.  In fact, Alabama called simulations fundamentally flawed for not reproducing its own map and for not incorporating all traditional redistricting criteria. At Gingles 1, this Court requires us to use sample plans that Alabama is not ultimately obligated to adopt, but those plans need not be the ultimate remedy. And that's because, as this Court said in Brnovich, Section 2 looks at the totality of the circumstances, not, as Alabama would have it, the totality of just one. Section 2 is not an intent test or about putting on racial blinders.  It is about equal opportunity, opportunity that Alabama's map denies black voters.  Thank you.</td>\n",

Alabama's reliance on untested simulations would unravel decades of progress and take us back to a time with little to no minority representation at the federal, state, and local levels. This Court should reaffirm its established Section 2 standard because it works. It limits the scope of liability and it ensures that with increased progress comes decreased enforcement.

And I actually think the question is, why should we require at Gingles Step 1 that a map be drawn in a race-neutral way?  And there are two possibilities, right? It's -- one possibility is because that's what Congress would have wanted, but when I read Section 2, I don't see that Congress is requiring race neutrality. In fact, the language beyond equally open is equally open by participation of members in a particular class of citizens in that its  members have less opportunity than other members.  So it seems as though Congress is authorizing the consideration of race. And then the second question is, all right, why should we do this?  Because the Constitution requires some sort of race neutrality, and based on my colloquy with --with -- with your friend on the other side, I think that the Constitution doesn't require it.

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court's factual findings make this an extreme and atypical case of vote dilution.  Voting in Alabama is intensely racially polarized, about as stark as anywhere in the country. The history and effects of racial discrimination in the state are severe.  Black voters are significantly underrepresented and they're sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a reasonably configured district, as the district court specifically found. Section 2's results test was designed for this kind of case. For that reason, Alabama isn't asking the Court to apply Section 2 as it's been applied for the past 40 years. Instead, Alabama is asking the Court to radically change the law by inserting this concept of race neutrality and effectively limiting Section 2 to intentional   discrimination. That approach would delete the text that Congress added in 1982 to cover results. It disregards nearly four decades of this Court's precedent, and it would have drastic real-world consequences. Under the state's approach, nothing would stop Alabama and many other states from dismantling their existing majority-minority districts, leaving black voters and entire swaths of the country with no ability to elect their preferred representatives. The Court should reject that destabilizing and atextual interpretation of Section 2. I'd like to turn if I could to the questions that Justice Barrett and Justice Jackson were just asking about the narrower form of Alabama's argument and specifically whether it makes sense to put plaintiffs to the burden of showing that they can draw their maps in a race-neutral way. And I think the problem with that approach is that it's contrary to the text, would be unworkable in practice, and it also is  unnecessary to address the concern Alabama's raising about unconstitutional districts. So if I could just unpack that a little bit.  Specifically, with respect to the text, the problem with using race neutrality as the touchstone here is that's inherently focused on motives or purposes in designing the districts, and I think one thing that has been clear for the past four decades, ever since Congress amended the statute, is that that is no longer the necessary requirement under Section 2.</td>\n",

This is a rigorous burden on plaintiffs.  Of course, they have to show the patterns of racially polarized voting in the second and third preconditions, and courts then go on to look at all of the relevant circumstances in the totality analysis. And if you actually look at actual results in these cases, there are -- are steadily decreasing Section 2 claims that are filed in the first place.  And then it's not as though plaintiffs always prevail in those claims.  Courts routinely reject them because the other factors aren't satisfied. So I think it would just be incorrect to suggest at the outset that simply by virtue of showing that first threshold screen the plaintiffs are going to be able to run the table.

It's not an area where the Court's decisions have flown under the radar or escaped notice. Congress has not hesitated to step in and alter the statute when it's been dissatisfied with this Court's interpretation. That was the whole point of the 1982 amendments. So I think that's Exhibit A of the principle here. And far from disrupting or disturbing the Gingles framework in any way, Congress has repeatedly left Section 2 untouched while it's amended other aspects of the statute. And in the 2006 amendments, the House report specifically noted that Congress did not intend any departure from Gingles or its progeny.

This Court didn't depart from Gingles and De Grandy when it recognized the importance of proportionality.  You didn't depart from Gingles when you added traditional districting principles to the analysis when the Court started focusing on single member districts.  So we are not asking for Gingles to be overruled or changed in any dramatic way.  We just need some clarification. And a couple points about the clear error or the standard of review. When it comes to compactness, that was a legal error because they left out important traditional districting principles and -- and said that's fine, you only have to account for some of the traditional districting principles, not all of them.  It's -- it's very easy to satisfy Gingles if you get to play by completely different rules, and Gingles just isn't going to do anything useful if that's the case. When it comes to predominance, that's a legal error.  Just like in Bethune-Hill, just like in ALBC, that's reviewed de novo. Now the main point, I mean, courts can -- the Court can resolve this case by clarifying that race cannot be the non-negotiable principle as part of Section 2 liability. Simulations are not required.  We just need to make sure that plaintiffs are coming forward with some sort of evidence that resembles what you would think a race-neutral map drawer would do within the confines of the equal protection clause because, if you read Section 2 to be inconsistent with Cooper and Bethune-Hill, then our maps are always going to be in court. And we've got a real live example of this with the Louisiana case that's pending before this Court as well.  Back in the '90s, they drew two majority black districts.  Twice district courts said that's racial   gerrymandering and tossed them out.  So then they drew one majority black district, and now this year they were -- their -- their map is again preliminarily enjoined for failure to draw two majority black districts.  I think it's a perfect example of just how the states are caught in the middle here. And it's because the plaintiffs don't have a clear test.  We -- we -- maximization is not the test.  Proportionality is not the test. Some smattering of seven factors doesn't provide sort of guidance we need either. That only identifies broad societal discrimination, not the sort of discrimination needed to justify race-based map drawing. So, if you return to the text, there really is no better test that ensures equal opportunity and equal openness than a map that looks like what you would expect a neutral map drawer to draw, consistent with the equal protection clause. I mean, imagine for a second that you are a member of the Georgia legislature and all your guidance on Section 2 and the equal protection clause comes from the district court   opinion below.  You would be completely in the dark. You know that you can account for traditional districting principles, but, apparently, one of your most important communities of interest there in the Gulf is not a sufficient community of interest to justify drawing a neutral map. You know that you've maintained cores of your districts and that Supreme Court in Abrams even said that's fine as part of the --the Gingles 1 analysis, but the district court said, well, here, it's not going to be the case. So your map is going to end up in court again and again.  That cannot be the case. We need some sort of guidance from this Court. In sum, the purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination and to foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race, but plaintiffs would transform that statute into one that requires racial discrimination in districting and carries us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters. Neither the text nor purpose of the  Act supports that vulcanizing approach, and the Constitution forbids it.  If Section 2 is to apply to single member districts, then only a race-neutral benchmark furthers the VRA's goals of -- and its equal openness touchstone. And because Alabama's neutrally drawn plan is equally open to all voters, it complies with Section 2.  Thank you.</td>\n",

       "1     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama conducted its 2021 redistricting in a lawful, race-neutral manner. The state largely retained its existing districts and made changes needed to equalize population.  But that wasn't good enough for the plaintiffs. They argue that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to replace its map with a racially gerrymandered plan maximizing the number of majority-minority districts. But Section 2 requires an electoral process equally open to all, not one that guarantees maximum political success for some over others.  Section 2 does not and cannot  obligate Alabama to abandon district lines enveloping the undisputed longstanding community of interest in the Gulf to be replaced by district lines dividing black and white with such racial precision that Alabama could never have constitutionally drawn those lines in the first place. Yet, that is what Alabama has been commanded to do here:  redraw its districts to subordinate traditional districting principles to race.  The only way to add a second majority-minority district to Alabama's plan is to make race the non-negotiable criterion. Plaintiffs' illustrative plans prove the point. They offer only one way to get that second majority-black district:  split Mobile County and divide the Gulf by race. Their new versions of Districts 1 and 2 then stretch the width of the state to group together black voters from disparate areas as far west as Mobile and as far east as the Georgia border. The District Court relied on these outlier plans to invalidate the state's neutrally drawn map, and that was legal error. Requiring states to scrap neutral plans in favor  of plans drawn on account of race set Section 2 at war with itself and with the Constitution. The Court should make clear that if a state's plan is the product of the state's neutral districting principles, the plan is equally open to all voters.  Because Alabama's 2021 plan is such a plan, Plaintiffs' claims fail. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "5     Yes, Your Honor.  I think, as this Court noted both in the Holder v. Hall plurality and in Brnovich, benchmarks are critical in any Section 2 case. And we proposed a benchmark to the Court. Plaintiffs have not proposed any benchmark other than perhaps maximization or proportionality.  But, of course, Section 2 rejects a proportionality baseline, and this Court has wisely rejected maximization and proportionality because they lead to constitutional problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "12     I guess I ask because  what strikes me about this case is that under our precedent it's kind of a slam dunk if you just take our existing precedent the way it is, and the three judges below all found this.  The three judges below said this is an easy case. It's not one of the hard ones. It's not one of the boundary line cases. It was clear that the plaintiffs satisfied the Gingles preconditions.  It's --and -- and past that, you know, you're looking at a state where there are -- 27 percent of the population is African American but only one of seven districts where there is incredible racially polarized voting, where there is a long history of racial discrimination in the state. Put all that together and it seems clear that under our existing precedents, the inquiry is complete in just the way that the --that the -- that the court below found.

       "26     Sure.  You know, nobody disputes that intent isn't relevant.  The question is, is intent required? And when I read your brief, the -- all over it, you suggest that intent is required.  And I thought that we have said on numerous occasions that intent is not required, and the reason we've said it on numerous occasions is because that's what Congress said. We once long ago said that intent was required in Voting Right -- in the Voting -- Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and Congress immediately slapped us down and said no, we didn't mean that and made clear in the language of the statute that it was incorporating a results test, an effects test. And yet your -- your -- your arguments, as Justice Jackson has suggested, really say that that's wrong and that there needs to be a showing of intent in order to make out a Section 2 violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Regester, they were importing that invidious discrimination test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "28     I mean, to make this a question of dicta in the cases when you have Congress saying results in and then setting out an entire subsection about what it means to  result in unequal access to the political process, and then Gingles says, well, we acknowledge that this was a response to Bolden, where we held that proof of discriminatory intent was required, and we say Congress revised Section 2 to make clear that a violation could be proved by showing discriminatory effect alone. And then we said it in Chisom.

What exactly is your submission under Section 2 that, in particular, the relation between the computer analysis that you've submitted and why your argument is not an effort to resuscitate the intent test that Congress has rejected under Section 2?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "125   Well, Your Honor, we think that, as I mentioned before, intent is not irrelevant.  Even the Milligan plaintiffs agree at page -- I don't have the page right in front of me -- page 20 in their brief that Section 2 requires evidence relevant to the issue of intentional discrimination. Well, we've got phenomenal evidence that they brought forward, and this was another  fact I need to clear up because the United States and both sets of plaintiffs got it wrong in their briefs. But Dr. Imai, he was their --he was the Milligan plaintiffs' expert who was working with the 2020 data. And he drew 10,000 -- three sets of 10,000 maps.  The third set guaranteed one majority black district of 50 to 51 percent, razor thin, leaving as many black voters as possible to find in the other six districts and form a second majority-minority district, then contiguity equal population, keep counties together, stay relatively compact, don't pair incumbents and then prioritize communities of interest. And they've said again and again that he didn't take into account communities of interest.  That is flatly wrong. He did.  And so what he was told to do by the Milligan plaintiffs was to prioritize putting the Gulf counties together and prioritize putting the 23 Black Belt counties together. When he did that, he had one majority black district that was preprogrammed, and then the second highest BVAP district averaged about  36 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "127   Well, a -- a few points, Your Honor.  I mean, if you inject race as a traditional districting principle, which is what both plaintiffs' map drawers said they did. They treated race as a traditional districting   principle.  It's going to have that hydraulic effect and it's going to make it harder to comport with traditional districting principles and you're going to end up with a map that's not going to do as well. Also, I mean, intent is not irrelevant.  If we've shown conclusively that we're achieving our legitimate goals, that has to factor in. I think even the dissent in Brnovich said a Section 2 plaintiff needs to show that it's not possible for the state to achieve its legitimate goals in some way. And -- and it's -- we've shown that. It is impossible for us to achieve undisputably legitimate goals of keeping the Gulf together, of maintaining our preexisting district lines in a large amount, and keeping relatively compact districts that someone could look at from Alabama and recognize why they were drawn that way without looking and seeing the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "140   -- but plaintiffs, none of their map drawers cared at all about preexisting district lines.  So they took into   account -- he took into account the same things they were taking into account, and when he did, without also putting race into account, that's the one thing he didn't take into account, then you come back with maps that come nowhere close to creating a second majority-black district, which shows that race was the criteria and that could not be compromised.  I mean, it's textbook predominance. We could have never drawn those maps constitutionally.  And, again, just to get back to, like, the general confusion here, it puts us in an obvious rock and a hard place.  They're using maps we could have never drawn to force us to draw maps that, like, again, we couldn't have ever drawn. So that cannot be how the equal openness mandate of Section 2 works.  It needs to work in harmony with the equal protection mandate of the Constitution, not in conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

And I don't think --                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "152    Okay.  Well, I think what Section 2 is trying to get at is it's trying to ensure equal political opportunities. That's what -- so let me just use that as a segue to my last question, which is that, you know, this is an important statute.  It's one of the great achievements of American democracy to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as -- as -- as white Americans could.  That's a pretty big deal. And it was strengthened, this statute, in 1982 when this Court interpreted it too narrowly for Congress's taste, and Congress said no, we didn't mean that at all and made this into a results test. Now, in recent years, this statute has fared not well in this Court.  Shelby County looks at Section 5 and it says no, Section 5, we don't need that anymore, and one of the things it says is we have Section 2. And then Brnovich comes along, and that's a Section 2 case, and the Court says: You know what, Section 2, they're really   dilution claims.  You know, this is a denial claim, and -- and so we can construe that very narrowly.  But, of course, there's just all these cases that are dilution claims.  That's really what Section 2 is about. And now here we are, Section 2 is a dilution claim, this -- you know, the classic Section 2 dilution claim.  And you're asking us essentially to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this too extremely difficult to prevail on. So what's left?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "153   Justice Kagan, the Voting Rights Act has achieved tremendous gains.  In 2016, for example, Alabama, black voters turned out at 4.6 points higher than white voters, even though nationwide that gap was 2.3 percent the other direction.  In 2018, much the same story. We had the second highest black registration in the country, second only to Mississippi.  So I think we need to not lose sight of that. In terms of what Section 2 is supposed to be doing, I think the problem here is we're kind of in like a third generation of vote dilution claims.  You have the multi-member   districts is generation 1. Generation 2 was getting rid of the racial gerrymanders. But generation 3 is let's impose the racial gerrymanders, which I don't think Section 2 was ever designed to do. It's what's led to all this confusion and this tension between an equal openness statute and equal protection mandate. And we're just saying, like, that cannot be what it means.  Whatever it means, it can't be that we have to obliterate longstanding, unprecedented -- I mean undisputed communities of interest in favor of districts that sort of arch across the state to connect people from Mobile and Dothan, which no neutral map drawer would ever do. And, obviously, it was not the concerns of the 1982 Congress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "167   Because they ignore other traditional districting principles.  So like we -- as we noted, preexisting district lines, a core retention has been something the state has given effect to for a long time. This Court in Karcher said that is a legitimate goal in redistricting. And the district court said:  Well, you don't have to account for that traditional districting principle because that would make it really hard to satisfy Gingles.  Well, but that's the whole point of the traditional districting principles inquiry, is -- is -- is not to make it easy. It's to make sure that what they come up with is essentially playing by similar rules as the state. And -- and they just got to set aside the ones that they didn't like that got in the way. That can't be what reasonably configured means or what account for traditional districting principles means. And they say, well, there's no   precedent for taking into account core retention.  That's not true.  If you go back to Abrams, I mean, after Miller, with the max back -- max black plan foisted upon Georgia in the --after the 1990 census, it was sent back to the district court, who was forced to end up drawing a map for Georgia's 11 congressional districts. Georgia at that time, just like Alabama today, was 27 percent black population. And the judge was trying to comply with Section 2, including this compactness inquiry, and so he said let's look at the traditional districting principles of the state.

       "185   I -- I don't think we  lose. I think -- I mean, I think there are going to be some cases where Section 2 violation lines up with an equal protection clause violation and might satisfy strict scrutiny. So, for example, if there's race in the lines, then, yeah, you have to have a race-based remedy to take the race out of the lines. But I don't think there's a sufficiently compelling interest here based on, for example, the showing that they made, where they really just showed some broad-based societal discrimination.  They didn't show anything wrong with our maps.  So it -- it cannot be that that is specifically identified discrimination that could justify using race to change our map. I mean, you can go through that entire 250-plus pages of opinion from the district court and really kind of miss our map altogether, other than the fact that it doesn't produce a second black district. And that just shows how far afield the Section 2 inquiry really has come in this case.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "188    Yes. I am so, so glad for Justice Barrett's clarification because I had the same thought about what you were arguing, and I'm glad that you clarified that your core point is that the Gingles test has to have a race-neutral baseline or that the -- the first step has to be race-neutral. And -- and what I guess I'm a little confused about in light of that argument is why, given our normal assessment of the Constitution, why is it that you think that there's a Fourteenth Amendment problem?  And let me just clarify what I mean by that. I don't think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way.  That they were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen in -- during the reconstructive -- reconstruction period were actually brought equal to everyone else in the society. So I looked at the report that was submitted by the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment, and that report says that the entire point of the amendment was to secure rights of the freed former slaves. The legislator who introduced that amendment said that \"unless the Constitution should restrain them, those states will all, I fear, keep up this discrimination and crush to death the hated freedmen.\" That's not -- that's not a race-neutral or race-blind idea in terms of the remedy.  And -- and even more than that, I don't think that the historical record establishes that the founders believed that race neutrality or race blindness was required, right?  They drafted the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which specifically stated that citizens would have the  same civil rights as enjoyed by white citizens. That's the point of that Act, to make sure that the other citizens, the black citizens, would have the same as the white citizens. So they recognized that there was unequal treatment, that people, based on their race, were being treated unequally. And, importantly, when there was a concern that the Civil Rights Act wouldn't have a constitutional foundation, that's when the Fourteenth Amendment came into play.  It was drafted to give a foundational -- a constitutional foundation for a piece of legislation that was designed to make people who had less opportunity and less rights equal to white citizens. So with that as the framing and the background, I'm trying to understand your position that Section 2, which by its plain text is doing that same thing, is saying you need to identify people in this community who have less opportunity and less ability to participate and ensure that that's remedied, right?  It's a race-conscious effort, as you have indicated. I'm trying to understand why that violates the   Fourteenth Amendment, given the history and --and background of the Fourteenth Amendment?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "190    No, but as -- the record shows that the reason why the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted was to give a constitutional foundation for that kind of effort, for the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which was doing what the Section 2 is doing here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "199   Well, no, Your Honor, if -- if their evidence is bad, then you run the risk of replacing a neutral plan with a plan drawn on account of race, which would create its own Section 2 violations.  I think a white Republican in Mobile or a black Republican in Mobile, for that matter, who's gerrymandered into the new District 2 and connected with people on the Georgia border would have a Section 2 claim himself because his vote has been abridged on account of race. So you can't read Section 2 that way. Equal openness and equal protection need to line up. And they don't under Plaintiffs' approach. And we need a benchmark because obviously we need some clarity in this space.  We've offered a benchmark.  I have seen no benchmark in the briefs from the United States or the Plaintiffs, and -- and maybe they can illuminate that for us in just a moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "201   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: There is nothing race-neutral about Alabama's map.  The district court's unanimous and thorough intensely local analysis did not err in finding that the Black Belt is a historic and extremely poor community of substantial significance.  Yet, Alabama's map cracks that community and allows white block voting to deny black voters the opportunity to elect representation responsive to their needs. Rather than argue clear error, Alabama asks us to ignore statutory stare decisis and to rewrite Section 2's text.  But the Voting Rights Act is a remedial statute that Congress has twice reenacted since Gingles, and its application here raises no constitutional concerns. That is because Plaintiffs' maps show, consistent with Bartlett, that it is possible to draw maps that look very similar to Alabama's own Board of Education map and that increase   opportunities for minority voters, while satisfying traditional and state redistricting criteria at least as well as Alabama's map. Nothing in the text of Section 2 allows Alabama to avoid liability by offering up these post hoc rationalizations of simulations and core retention for maps that result in discrimination.  In fact, Alabama called simulations fundamentally flawed for not reproducing its own map and for not incorporating all traditional redistricting criteria. At Gingles 1, this Court requires us to use sample plans that Alabama is not ultimately obligated to adopt, but those plans need not be the ultimate remedy. And that's because, as this Court said in Brnovich, Section 2 looks at the totality of the circumstances, not, as Alabama would have it, the totality of just one. Section 2 is not an intent test or about putting on racial blinders.  It is about equal opportunity, opportunity that Alabama's map denies black voters.  Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "205   Your Honor, again, Section 2, as you know, is about intent and not --doesn't speak -- or, excuse me, is about results and doesn't speak to intent. And so, you know, with respect to the biases of a mapmaker, I'm not sure if that's relevant. But I will say, as this Court has acknowledged, that Gingles 1 does take into consideration compliance with traditional redistricting criteria.  And those redistricting criteria that the state -- that this Court has listed are compactness, contiguity, respect for  communities of interest and political subdivisions. And the district court found on all of those that Plaintiffs' plans meet or beat Alabama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "225   Your Honor, I don't think that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act at all requires maximization.  And, here, you couldn't meet Gingles 1 and so we're not in any way suggesting that.

       "245    The -- the other side says that the proposed districts are not reasonably compact, and, as I was mentioning, I think compactness is the key under our precedents to interpreting Section 2 correctly and the equal protection requirements.

       "246   Yes, Your Honor.  Again, I think the district court's findings, which are subject to clear error, made clear that plaintiffs' plans met or beat Alabama on the compactness requirement. With respect to, you know, Alabama's allegation that our map goes -- that our plan goes across the state, so does some of Alabama's plan. And, again, Alabama's own Board of Education map, which was drawn at the same time using the same redistricting criteria, which in Alabama's guidelines includes race, created virtually the same district that also spreads across the state. And then, Your Honor, you -- you had a question earlier about, you know, what these traditional redistricting guidelines are.  This Court in Perry versus Perez recognized that, you know, they -- when you're drawing remedial maps, that you have to take into consideration state  and local redistricting criteria, except those -- to the extent those criteria violate Section 2. And, here, core retention is -- is nearly always going to violate Section 2. And -- and our plans tried to take those into --that factor into account as much as possible without perpetuating the violation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

It's because, you know, it -- it only triggers in situations in which you have this compactness, you know, presumably due to the racial polarization or stratification of the kind of district and people are continuing to vote in racial block -- racially blocked ways, but if that stopped happening, if what we all want, which would be people to spread out and live among one another and vote based on their, you know, own views as opposed to along racial lines, then we wouldn't have a Section 2 violation, is that correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "258   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Alabama seeks to upend the Section 2 standard that has governed redistricting for nearly 40 years.  But Alabama's novel theories not only defy statutory text and precedent, they would cause profound upheaval for courts, states, and minority voters. Requiring a race-blind demonstration at Gingles 1 would bury courts in litigation, in new litigation challenging maps created in reliance on the existing standard.  Make no mistake, nearly every majority-minority district would become a litigation target.  Alabama's reliance on untested simulations would unravel decades of progress and take us back to a time with little to no minority representation at the federal, state, and local levels. This Court should reaffirm its established Section 2 standard because it works. It limits the scope of liability and it ensures that with increased progress comes decreased enforcement.  In many places, racially polarized voting and racial segregation are declining, making satisfaction of Gingles impossible, but as three judges agreed, that is not yet the case in Alabama. I welcome the Court's questions.

       "290    I do, counsel. Justice Alito gave the game away when he said race-neutral means don't look at community of interest because it's a proxy for race. Regrettably, that is what it is in many situations. That's why Mobile and Baldwin are together, no matter what they talk about being around a river or not. That has very little to do with anything other than race, that they come generations later from Germany -- from France or Spain. But the point that he's making turns   Section 2 on its head, doesn't it, because there's no such thing as racial neutrality in Section 2. It's explicitly saying that a protected group must be given equal participation, correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "308    Yes. So following up on Justice Barrett's question, setting aside the practicalities of the map-making process, which is basically what you've been focusing on, I think the question is, why should we make the Gingles 1 challengers do that? In other words, it seems as though some of my colleagues are asking the question if -- you know, if you have a million maps and you can generate a million maps, why shouldn't we require that one map be drawn in a race-neutral way? And I actually think the question is, why should we require at Gingles Step 1 that a map be drawn in a race-neutral way?  And there are two possibilities, right? It's -- one possibility is because that's what Congress would have wanted, but when I read Section 2, I don't see that Congress is requiring race neutrality. In fact, the language beyond equally open is equally open by participation of members in a particular class of citizens in that its  members have less opportunity than other members.  So it seems as though Congress is authorizing the consideration of race. And then the second question is, all right, why should we do this?  Because the Constitution requires some sort of race neutrality, and based on my colloquy with --with -- with your friend on the other side, I think that the Constitution doesn't require it. So am I -- do I have the question right, why should we require this, or does Justice Barrett have the question right, why shouldn't we?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

It would be a brand-new principle that  really doesn't serve any end, the end result is -- the end result gets us to the exact same place that we have right now, which is, is it possible to show up in court with a district that meets these criteria? And to, you know -- and, here, where we talk about what does -- what does the usual map drawer in Alabama draw, what's considered a sprawling district in Alabama, the best place to look is to the very guidelines that -- that my friend on the other side specifically mentioned. And those guidelines take into account contiguity, compactness, political subdivision boundaries, precincts, all of these things that our maps performed as good or better and they also take into account race, and they say that complying with the Voting Rights Act shall come before anything else and specifically including core preservations and communities of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "314    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court's factual findings make this an extreme and atypical case of vote dilution.  Voting in Alabama is intensely racially polarized, about as stark as anywhere in the country. The history and effects of racial discrimination in the state are severe.  Black voters are significantly underrepresented and they're sufficiently numerous and compact to form a majority in a reasonably configured district, as the district court specifically found. Section 2's results test was designed for this kind of case. For that reason, Alabama isn't asking the Court to apply Section 2 as it's been applied for the past 40 years. Instead, Alabama is asking the Court to radically change the law by inserting this concept of race neutrality and effectively limiting Section 2 to intentional   discrimination. That approach would delete the text that Congress added in 1982 to cover results. It disregards nearly four decades of this Court's precedent, and it would have drastic real-world consequences. Under the state's approach, nothing would stop Alabama and many other states from dismantling their existing majority-minority districts, leaving black voters and entire swaths of the country with no ability to elect their preferred representatives. The Court should reject that destabilizing and atextual interpretation of Section 2. I'd like to turn if I could to the questions that Justice Barrett and Justice Jackson were just asking about the narrower form of Alabama's argument and specifically whether it makes sense to put plaintiffs to the burden of showing that they can draw their maps in a race-neutral way. And I think the problem with that approach is that it's contrary to the text, would be unworkable in practice, and it also is  unnecessary to address the concern Alabama's raising about unconstitutional districts. So if I could just unpack that a little bit.  Specifically, with respect to the text, the problem with using race neutrality as the touchstone here is that's inherently focused on motives or purposes in designing the districts, and I think one thing that has been clear for the past four decades, ever since Congress amended the statute, is that that is no longer the necessary requirement under Section 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "331    I think the state can win on any other of the relevant factors in the totality of the circumstances. And I want to resist strongly this idea that any time plaintiffs have been able to satisfy that first Gingles precondition, they automatically prove their case. This is a rigorous burden on plaintiffs.  Of course, they have to show the patterns of racially polarized voting in the second and third preconditions, and courts then go on to look at all of the relevant circumstances in the totality analysis. And if you actually look at actual results in these cases, there are -- are steadily decreasing Section 2 claims that are filed in the first place.  And then it's not as though plaintiffs always prevail in those claims.  Courts routinely reject them because the other factors aren't satisfied. So I think it would just be incorrect to suggest at the outset that simply by virtue of showing that first threshold screen the plaintiffs are going to be able to run the table. And I want to make clear that the  Gingles preconditions only screen out meritless cases. They're never dispositive of liability in and of themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "350    I think this is exactly the undertheorized aspect of Alabama's approach here because they don't try to answer any of those questions either about how you operationalize the standard and agree upon how to program the algorithm to take account of all of the complex constellation of redistricting criteria or how you interpret the results along  the lines you were suggesting.  Is -- is one map enough?  Do you need a hundred, a thousand? They don't say. And I think that that just demonstrates that this is an incredibly untested form of evidence. It's never been required in Section 2 litigation.  And I think trying to insert this as an insuperable requirement in Gingles Step 1 would cause all kinds of complicated litigation and battles of the experts about how to even interpret and run those types of simulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "353    I'm not aware of any current proposals in Congress to do that. And, actually, I think this is a critically important point, Justice Kavanaugh, because, of course, this is a statutory interpretation case. This Court has emphasized that stare  decisis considerations have their greatest force here. And it's the Voting Rights Act. It's not an area where the Court's decisions have flown under the radar or escaped notice. Congress has not hesitated to step in and alter the statute when it's been dissatisfied with this Court's interpretation. That was the whole point of the 1982 amendments. So I think that's Exhibit A of the principle here. And far from disrupting or disturbing the Gingles framework in any way, Congress has repeatedly left Section 2 untouched while it's amended other aspects of the statute. And in the 2006 amendments, the House report specifically noted that Congress did not intend any departure from Gingles or its progeny. So I think that those stare decisis considerations really weigh heavily in the balance here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "356   Thank you.  I've got five quick points.  I'll try to get through all of them. Justice Kavanaugh, to your point, it is not a departure from Gingles to clarify. This Court didn't depart from Gingles and De Grandy when it recognized the importance of proportionality.  You didn't depart from Gingles when you added traditional districting principles to the analysis when the Court started focusing on single member districts.  So we are not asking for Gingles to be overruled or changed in any dramatic way.  We just need some clarification. And a couple points about the clear error or the standard of review. When it comes to compactness, that was a legal error because they left out important traditional districting principles and -- and said that's fine, you only have to account for some of the traditional districting principles, not all of them.  It's -- it's very easy to satisfy Gingles if you get to play by completely different rules, and Gingles just isn't going to do anything useful if that's the case. When it comes to predominance, that's a legal error.  Just like in Bethune-Hill, just like in ALBC, that's reviewed de novo. Now the main point, I mean, courts can -- the Court can resolve this case by clarifying that race cannot be the non-negotiable principle as part of Section 2 liability. Simulations are not required.  We just need to make sure that plaintiffs are coming forward with some sort of evidence that resembles what you would think a race-neutral map drawer would do within the confines of the equal protection clause because, if you read Section 2 to be inconsistent with Cooper and Bethune-Hill, then our maps are always going to be in court. And we've got a real live example of this with the Louisiana case that's pending before this Court as well.  Back in the '90s, they drew two majority black districts.  Twice district courts said that's racial   gerrymandering and tossed them out.  So then they drew one majority black district, and now this year they were -- their -- their map is again preliminarily enjoined for failure to draw two majority black districts.  I think it's a perfect example of just how the states are caught in the middle here. And it's because the plaintiffs don't have a clear test.  We -- we -- maximization is not the test.  Proportionality is not the test. Some smattering of seven factors doesn't provide sort of guidance we need either. That only identifies broad societal discrimination, not the sort of discrimination needed to justify race-based map drawing. So, if you return to the text, there really is no better test that ensures equal opportunity and equal openness than a map that looks like what you would expect a neutral map drawer to draw, consistent with the equal protection clause. I mean, imagine for a second that you are a member of the Georgia legislature and all your guidance on Section 2 and the equal protection clause comes from the district court   opinion below.  You would be completely in the dark. You know that you can account for traditional districting principles, but, apparently, one of your most important communities of interest there in the Gulf is not a sufficient community of interest to justify drawing a neutral map. You know that you've maintained cores of your districts and that Supreme Court in Abrams even said that's fine as part of the --the Gingles 1 analysis, but the district court said, well, here, it's not going to be the case. So your map is going to end up in court again and again.  That cannot be the case. We need some sort of guidance from this Court. In sum, the purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination and to foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race, but plaintiffs would transform that statute into one that requires racial discrimination in districting and carries us further from the goal of a political system in which race no longer matters. Neither the text nor purpose of the  Act supports that vulcanizing approach, and the Constitution forbids it.  If Section 2 is to apply to single member districts, then only a race-neutral benchmark furthers the VRA's goals of -- and its equal openness touchstone. And because Alabama's neutrally drawn plan is equally open to all voters, it complies with Section 2.  Thank you.   \n",

       "      <td>We'll hear argument next in Case 21-442, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

RIDER-LONGMAID:  I -- I think I would say it this way, Your Honor.  I think someone -- I think a prisoner could exit the state court procedures at any point and bring a Section 1983 action at that time and in -- in all likelihood would allow, as -- as -- as I think Your Honor posits, the time for rehearing  to lapse. And I think that would be okay.  There would be harm at that point.  The -- the --there would be a cause of action at that point.

       "      <td>Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.</td>\n",

Just three points. Justice Alito and Justice Barrett asked about I think the exhaustion question and whether exhaustion would be required. I don't think the Court has to address that here.  I don't think it is required.  I don't think the Court has to address it because, of course, Mr. Reed, if you look at it this way, did exhaust all of the available procedures and, therefore, Mr. Reed must be correct in this case if that is a requirement. But, if it's not a requirement, then we're saying by analogy you would look to traditional due process claims and they're all the practical reasons, of course, to wait until the state court proceedings are over. The second point is I didn't hear any practical concerns maybe until the end there about capital defendants as to why Goertz's rule is superior or why it's more administrable.  I think Mr. Reed's rule is the clearest, most administrable, simple rule here.  And, finally, as to -- as to the delay question, many defendants are going to be non-capital defendants like Osborne, and those people are going to be subject to the same regime.  And nothing is going to happen to them. They're not going to see -- see their freedom one day sooner if they don't prevail in these proceedings.  So there's no reason not to allow the proceedings to fully play out. And as to Mr. Reed, what I would say is that it's my understanding that you do not get a stay of execution just because you brought an Article 64 proceeding or just because you're in Section 1983 proceedings before a federal court challenging the adequacy of the procedures available to you from the state. Mr. Reed has a stay of execution from the Texas courts on his ninth subsequent habeas petition before the courts where he raised evidence that Fennell admitted to killing Stites because he discovered she was sleeping with a black man, that Fennell threatened to kill Stites if he caught her cheating, that Fennell made inculpatory statements at Stites' funeral and that Fennell and Stites' relationship was   fraught.  We have all the other evidence that Justice Sotomayor has pointed to and is in the briefing, and those are all serious things we think the Court should consider. So I think, when you look at the fact that no one's going to be able to get a stay of execution without some showing, there's really not a concern of delay in cases like these.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The key to Spending Clause statutes, this Court said in Arlington Central School District, \"is what the states are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of federal funds.\" Among the most costly conditions that may go along with the acceptance of federal funds is exposure to private litigation under Section 1983.  This Court made that precise point in Barnes against Gorman, in which it said with respect to a school that \"without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school\" -- or, as in this case, a nursing facility -- \"would  consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.\" States are therefore entitled, in our view, to clear notice that they will be subject to such private lawsuits if they expect -- if they accept Spending Clause money. Such a clear notice rule comports with the federalism and separation-of-powers principles at stake in these cases, and it accords as well with the common law treatment of third-party beneficiary claims at the time Section 1983 was enacted. At common law, third parties generally could not sue to enforce government contract rights unless the contract clearly specified that the breaching party would be liable to injured third parties.  Because the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act contains no such clear statement, it should not give rise to Section 1983 liability.  But, even if a clear notice rule is not required, the two purported rights that Respondent invokes under FNHRA do not give rise to Section 1983 claims. First, FNHRA and its implementing regulations provide a comprehensive suite of remedies, including a more restrictive private  remedy that forecloses Section 1983 relief under Rancho Palos Verdes.  And on this dispositive point, the U.S. Solicitor General agrees with us. Second, the two rights Respondent invokes are not unambiguously phrased in terms of the persons benefited. Instead, the two rights invoked here today are but a small piece of an overarching set of requirements addressed to nursing facilities that receive federal money. And the command to protect and promote those rights are, as in Blessing, system-wide commands, not an unambiguous assurance of individual entitlement.</td>\n",

First, they frustrate informed state assessment of Spending Clause programs.  Second, they disrupt state efforts to administer complex spending programs using scarce resources.  And, third, they -- they prevent states from pursuing policies valued more highly than full federal funding.           Fundamentally, private enforcement of federal spending conditions takes officials off the political hook for policy decisions and leaves voters without any elected officials to blame.

Petitioners provide no sound basis for revisiting that precedent. First, they offer no evidence that the Congress that enacted Section 1983 would have viewed breach-of-contract suits by third parties as remotely relevant to the new tort it was creating. Second, Petitioners can't show that their rule was the sort of well-settled background principle that Congress incorporates into a statute silently. And, finally, Congress has affirmatively confirmed that some rights created in the Social Security Act are enforceable through Section 1983.  Disregarding that ratification would unsettle decades of legitimate legislative reliance. This Court should accordingly reaffirm the framework that it applied in Gonzaga and Blessing.  Applying that framework here,  however, we agree that Congress displaced Section 1983 in FNHRA, and we therefore ask the Court to reverse on that basis alone.

But, for two reasons, we think that the remedy that Congress created here is -- is sufficient to displace 1983. The first is that it is an extensive system of remedies that include enforcement mechanisms by the Secretary himself.  So the states administer FNHRA in the sense that they provide surveyors who go out to each facility each year to make sure that the -- the  facilities are in compliance with FNHRA. But there is also an additional process by which the Secretary can impose sanctions on each facility.  They can impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day per violation. They can cut off further Medicaid funding at the facility.  They can require the installation of new management at the facility. And they can even order the facility to close.

We think that ordinarily -- Justice Kagan, you were getting at this -- ordinarily, when you have a system in which all of the regulated parties are state actors, and Congress creates an administrative enforcement mechanism, it would be unclear whether Congress intended that administrative mechanism to be exclusive or if, instead, Congress just assumed that Section 1983 would provide a background default rule that would also allow private suits. What's different about this case is  that Congress was acting in an area where a substantial number of the participants are private parties, and Congress contemplated providing a private cause of action against those private parties but left that out of the ultimate bill it enacted. And so we know that Congress believed that the administrative enforcement mechanism it was creating was sufficient for the 90 percent of nursing home residents who -- who live in privately operated -- operated facilities, and we think that's a very strong indication that it -- it didn't believe that a private cause of action --JUSTICE</td>\n",

In each of those three cases, there was a private judicial remedy. Now, in cases where this Court has found that Section 1983 was not displaced, the Court has emphasized the lack of either a judicial or an administrative mechanism. And so we think the fact that the Court has asked about the availability of an administrative mechanism suggests that in some cases that could be sufficient, and we think that it's sufficient here.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So a couple of things on that. One is that within the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created, it did address this concern about sort of -- I -- I think the negative characterization would be the state regulating state entities.  And in that context, Congress said that the Secretary would have responsibility for certifying state facilities and gave the Secretary the ability to impose enforcement remedies at state-operated facilities.  So we think that Congress accounted for it in that way. You mentioned that Congress said expressly no in the statute, and I think you were referring to (h)(8), so I wanted to wanted to address that provision.  We -- we understand  that provision to operate in the same way as the provisions that this Court addressed in Sea Clammers and Rancho Palos Verdes.  Congress, in that provision, was attempting to ensure that rights that -- that residents already had independently of FNHRA would not somehow be eliminated through the adoption of FNHRA. It spoke specifically to -- sorry. I'm looking at the language.  The -- it shouldn't be construed as limiting -- sorry --that the remedies it was creating were in addition to those otherwise available under state or federal law. We think that that \"otherwise available\" means rights that -- rights and remedies that the residents would have had without the adoption of FNHRA. We don't think that was speaking one way or the other to whether Congress intended for FNHRA to allow residents to bring new Section 1983 suits they hadn't been able to bring before.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we just draw a difference in -- a different inference from the way Congress structured the statute.  We also think, to -- to get to the point of the tension between the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created and Section 1983 remedies, that Congress specifically directed the ways in which money collected through civil penalties are be -- are to be spent, for example, and focused that on the -- the welfare of residents more broadly, as opposed to just going to an individual resident whose rights had been wronged. And so allowing Section 1983 suits that would sort of bypass that administrative enforcement mechanism and lead to funds being taken out of the nursing home system would be inconsistent with that congressional choice. I do want to take a moment -- I haven't gotten any questions on the first question presented, but I do want to bring up  the 1994 statutes, which, to the extent that there is any doubt about whether Thiboutot was correctly decided, we think that the two legislative ratifications that Congress adopted in 1994 put that to rest. In those statutes, Congress wrote that \"in an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act, such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of the Act requiring a state plan.\" I don't think there's any way to read that legislative text other than as embracing a -- a congressional expectation that at least some of the provisions of the Social Security Act would be enforceable under Section 1983. My friend's approach on the first question presented would say that no provisions of the Social Security Act can ever be enforced under Section 1983.  We think that was wrong as an original matter, but we also don't think that it can be reconciled with those 1994 statutes. With that, I'm happy to rest on our brief.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The difference between our position and the United States's position in this case is unbelievably narrow.  The United States agrees that this Court should not overrule decades of precedent holding that rights secured by Spending Clause laws are enforceable under Section 1983.  And the United States agrees that FNHRA creates two enforceable rights.  And we are obviously right about those points. The only point of departure is that the United States believes that Congress showed a clear intention to preclude access to 1983 by   extending FNHRA rights to residents of private nursing homes, even though they're not able to use 1983 to enforce those rights because 1983 only permits suits against government actors. That gets the statute backwards. FNHRA's text and context show that when Congress enacted the statute in 1987, it wanted to preserve access to all available remedies for FNHRA violations to the greatest extent possible. Thus, as no one disputes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of nursing home residents to sue to enforce their FNHRA rights in private lawsuits under state tort law.  And, as the United States concedes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of the Attorney General to enforce these rights under CRIPA, which is just Section 1983 for the Attorney General. We think it is equally clear that Congress wanted to preserve access to Section 1983 for two reasons.  First, the statute says it.  The statute's Savings Clause, on Joint Appendix 123, means what it says. The Savings Clause says that other remedies will  also be available to enforce FNHRA. The legislative history confirms that that is the correct reading of the text. Second, Congress had good reason to preserve 1983 specifically for residents of government nursing homes.  Congress knew that sovereign immunity often makes it more difficult or impossible to sue government nursing homes. Congress also understood that when states own the nursing homes, FNHRA's scheme, which depends on states to enforce FNHRA's requirements, falls apart. And Congress enacted FNHRA against a background of numerous laws, like CRIPA, RLUIPA, RFRA, and Section 1983 itself, that specifically hold governments to a higher standard to protect rights than private institutions. Finally, I would also like to reiterate that, even aside from all of the above, the actual standard in this Court's cases for finding implied preclusion is exceptionally high. It requires incompatibility between the remedies in the statute and Section 1983.  There is no incompatibility here. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

We don't know anything about what Congress knew, in fact, about the state of play in the nursing home industry. We don't know if Congress expected that in 10 years' time it would be flipped around and would be 10 percent private and 90 percent public. And it actually cashes out in this case because Indiana has made more than 90 percent of its nursing homes public.  So it is the exact flip reverse of the rest of the nation. And for the individuals in those nursing homes who confront very draconian limitations on their ability to actually enforce these rights under state law, against state-run nursing facilities, it is really Section 1983 that is filling the gap and making those rights real for those people. Congress doesn't create rights with the expectation that, generally, with the  expectation that someone else will come in and enforce those rights on your behalf. The way that the Solicitor General thinks this scheme should work and -- and HHC is that you are given rights. You are told of these rights orally and in writing on admission to the nursing home. They say you have the right to be free from restraints.  And your family reads this and then, if you -- you don't actually have any rights to enforce.

So, I mean, this family was crying out for help and using every possible lever at their disposal.  Section 1983 was the last resort. They went to seven medical malpractice attorneys and were turned away because the claim wasn't worth enough money in Indiana.  It -- this is -- this is a life-saver for people who cannot actually make effective use of the administrative scheme, and that is how 1983 functions, and it is, as we understand it, how it has functioned in Pennsylvania.  So, empirically, these suits are brought actually mostly as injunctive actions to remedy systemic, egregious policies of actually violating the federal rights in FNHRA.

You know, Justice Scalia in Blessing talked about the fact that new rights created in new statutes would still be presumptively enforceable under Section 1983.  No one would dispute that.  And we take the statute for what the words meant at the time, not necessarily for the scope of rights that would be protected. But, even if you disagree with all of that, these are actually the kinds of rights  that Section 1983 was enacted to protect, rights to bodily integrity and autonomy, fundamental rights, you know, if you map this onto the rights protected by the Constitution. So, if you're asking if this kind of tort would be the kind of right that you could enforce, I think the answer is an emphatic yes. If you're -- if you're asking about contract law, I don't think that the contract law analogy makes sense for numerous reasons.  Most obviously, Spending Clause legislation like this didn't exist, and the -- and the kind of analogy to Spending Clause legislation didn't emerge until the 20th Century.  So there's just no reliable way to even know that Congress would have thought that by using the spending power, as opposed to its commerce power, when enacting a rights-creating statute, it was making a fundamentally different decision with respect to its ratification of 1983.</td>\n",

       "0     We'll hear argument next in Case 21-442, Reed versus Goertz. Mr. Rider-Longmaid. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A claim modeled after Skinner accrues at the end of the state court litigation seeking DNA testing.  There are two sets of reasons why, one doctrinal, the other practical. First, doctrinally, a Skinner claim challenges the law, not a judgment.  So it makes sense to challenge what the state court of last resort authoritatively says the law means after that construction becomes final on denial of rehearing.  By analogy, appellate review does not proceed until a lower court denies rehearing, and traditional due process claims aren't complete until the state's full procedures deny due process. The fact is rehearing can change   reasoning and results.  And while a Section 1983 prisoner need not exhaust, just as a litigant need not seek rehearing, the clock doesn't start ticking until the state court procedures have come to an end. Second, as a practical matter, tying accrual to the end of state court litigation is simple, predictable, and sensible.  Tying accrual to some earlier stage is not.  Linking accrual to the trial court's judgment would disrespect the state court's appellate process and require a stay in almost every case.  It would clutter dockets with protective complaints, motions, and amended complaints. And it raises more questions than it answers. The Fifth Circuit said Reed's claim accrued in 2014, but now Goertz says 2016. Goertz's notice rule is unprincipled and unpredictable.  It will burden courts and litigants alike with uncertain analyses comparing various state court opinions. Accrual before denial of rehearing isn't much better.  It treats the state's rehearing process as irrelevant. It likewise threatens parallel litigation, especially in  states with busy courts and short limitations periods. Here's the straightforward answer:  A Skinner claim accrues at the end of the state court litigation. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "17     Well, an exhaustion requirement is just a requirement that says, even once you've suffered harm, you have to go through certain processes rather than bring suit. But this would be a statement that the harm doesn't occur until -- until the time when the opportunity for rehearing has gone by. MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  I -- I think I would say it this way, Your Honor.  I think someone -- I think a prisoner could exit the state court procedures at any point and bring a Section 1983 action at that time and in -- in all likelihood would allow, as -- as -- as I think Your Honor posits, the time for rehearing  to lapse. And I think that would be okay.  There would be harm at that point.  The -- the --there would be a cause of action at that point.

       "35     Well, suppose the difference is between a rule that says the statute of limitations runs when the Court of Criminal Appeals renders its decision and a rule that says it doesn't begin to run until   rehearing is denied.  Then you're talking about a -- a brief period of time, I would imagine, in most cases. In this instance, it -- it seems to have dragged out. So part of your argument is that your rule is better because it serves interests of federalism and comity, but how weighty is that if you're just talking about a relatively short period of time? MR. RIDER-LONGMAID: So I want to make two points as to the -- the additional time for rehearing, Your Honor. The first is that I think, symbolically, it just disrespects the -- the state court's appellate process to say we're not going to -- the federal court doesn't care about what happens after -- during the rehearing process. I think the second point is that, as the Court knows, Section 1983 statutes of limitations are borrowed from state law.  And so not every state is going to have a two-year, three-year, four-year statute of limitations.  I think Kentucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee we found have a one-year statute of limitations,  for example. And I don't think it's all that out of the ordinary for a rehearing motion to be pending -- in this case, it was six months --for a significant amount of time.  And, of course, the -- we normally don't think that someone is dilatory unless they've actually filed beyond the statute of limitations. I -- I think the other point that I would go to is it's not clear to me what purpose the statute of limitations is really serving here for Texas.  The -- most states -- and I would point you to the Retired Judges' amicus brief. Most states don't follow the same timeliness rules with these types of post-conviction DNA testing regimes as they do for their post-conviction habeas proceedings, for example, because they recognize, I think, as the Court said in Osborne, like, the power of DNA testing to exonerate as well as to inculpate. And so we don't have the types of concerns normally that you would have to protect with a statute of -- statute of limitations, such as concerns about faded memories of witnesses or stale evidence.  After all, if   anything, those concerns are going to count against the -- the prisoner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "139   Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Mr. Rider-Longmaid.          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PARKER RIDER-LONGMAID ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. RIDER-LONGMAID:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  Just three points. Justice Alito and Justice Barrett asked about I think the exhaustion question and whether exhaustion would be required. I don't think the Court has to address that here.  I don't think it is required.  I don't think the Court has to address it because, of course, Mr. Reed, if you look at it this way, did exhaust all of the available procedures and, therefore, Mr. Reed must be correct in this case if that is a requirement. But, if it's not a requirement, then we're saying by analogy you would look to traditional due process claims and they're all the practical reasons, of course, to wait until the state court proceedings are over. The second point is I didn't hear any practical concerns maybe until the end there about capital defendants as to why Goertz's rule is superior or why it's more administrable.  I think Mr. Reed's rule is the clearest, most administrable, simple rule here.  And, finally, as to -- as to the delay question, many defendants are going to be non-capital defendants like Osborne, and those people are going to be subject to the same regime.  And nothing is going to happen to them. They're not going to see -- see their freedom one day sooner if they don't prevail in these proceedings.  So there's no reason not to allow the proceedings to fully play out. And as to Mr. Reed, what I would say is that it's my understanding that you do not get a stay of execution just because you brought an Article 64 proceeding or just because you're in Section 1983 proceedings before a federal court challenging the adequacy of the procedures available to you from the state. Mr. Reed has a stay of execution from the Texas courts on his ninth subsequent habeas petition before the courts where he raised evidence that Fennell admitted to killing Stites because he discovered she was sleeping with a black man, that Fennell threatened to kill Stites if he caught her cheating, that Fennell made inculpatory statements at Stites' funeral and that Fennell and Stites' relationship was   fraught.  We have all the other evidence that Justice Sotomayor has pointed to and is in the briefing, and those are all serious things we think the Court should consider. So I think, when you look at the fact that no one's going to be able to get a stay of execution without some showing, there's really not a concern of delay in cases like these.                                                                                               \n",
       "1     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The key to Spending Clause statutes, this Court said in Arlington Central School District, \"is what the states are clearly told regarding the conditions that go along with the acceptance of federal funds.\" Among the most costly conditions that may go along with the acceptance of federal funds is exposure to private litigation under Section 1983.  This Court made that precise point in Barnes against Gorman, in which it said with respect to a school that \"without doubt, the scope of potential damages liability is one of the most significant factors a school\" -- or, as in this case, a nursing facility -- \"would  consider in deciding whether to receive federal funds.\" States are therefore entitled, in our view, to clear notice that they will be subject to such private lawsuits if they expect -- if they accept Spending Clause money. Such a clear notice rule comports with the federalism and separation-of-powers principles at stake in these cases, and it accords as well with the common law treatment of third-party beneficiary claims at the time Section 1983 was enacted. At common law, third parties generally could not sue to enforce government contract rights unless the contract clearly specified that the breaching party would be liable to injured third parties.  Because the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act contains no such clear statement, it should not give rise to Section 1983 liability.  But, even if a clear notice rule is not required, the two purported rights that Respondent invokes under FNHRA do not give rise to Section 1983 claims. First, FNHRA and its implementing regulations provide a comprehensive suite of remedies, including a more restrictive private  remedy that forecloses Section 1983 relief under Rancho Palos Verdes.  And on this dispositive point, the U.S. Solicitor General agrees with us. Second, the two rights Respondent invokes are not unambiguously phrased in terms of the persons benefited. Instead, the two rights invoked here today are but a small piece of an overarching set of requirements addressed to nursing facilities that receive federal money. And the command to protect and promote those rights are, as in Blessing, system-wide commands, not an unambiguous assurance of individual entitlement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "14    I don't disagree with that at all, Justice Kagan. What I do think, however, is that -- and, again, this is on the assumption now that we're talking about the Gonzaga inquiry. My threshold argument is based on the common law at the time Section 1983 was enacted and on federalism and separation-of-powers principles. But, if we are now in the guts of Question 2, I would suggest that the individual patient is not the unambiguous focus of this statute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "169   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Twenty years after Gonzaga, Section 1983 Spending Clause cases are unpredictable, with three consequences of particular concern for states.  First, they frustrate informed state assessment of Spending Clause programs.  Second, they disrupt state efforts to administer complex spending programs using scarce resources.  And, third, they -- they prevent states from pursuing policies valued more highly than full federal funding.           Fundamentally, private enforcement of federal spending conditions takes officials off the political hook for policy decisions and leaves voters without any elected officials to blame. Accordingly, the Court should finish what it started in Gonzaga and hold that federal spending conditions are not privately enforceable unless Congress expressly so provides.

       "212   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:  For half a century, this Court has recognized that Section 1983 means what it says, providing an express cause of action that by default applies to rights created by any federal statute.           Petitioners provide no sound basis for revisiting that precedent. First, they offer no evidence that the Congress that enacted Section 1983 would have viewed breach-of-contract suits by third parties as remotely relevant to the new tort it was creating. Second, Petitioners can't show that their rule was the sort of well-settled background principle that Congress incorporates into a statute silently. And, finally, Congress has affirmatively confirmed that some rights created in the Social Security Act are enforceable through Section 1983.  Disregarding that ratification would unsettle decades of legitimate legislative reliance. This Court should accordingly reaffirm the framework that it applied in Gonzaga and Blessing.  Applying that framework here,  however, we agree that Congress displaced Section 1983 in FNHRA, and we therefore ask the Court to reverse on that basis alone. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "214   So I think we would articulate the standard, frankly, much like Justice Kagan did.  We think that they can count in some circumstances.  We certainly don't think that they count in all circumstances. This Court has said that ordinarily a state administrative remedy is not sufficient to displace Section 1983. But, for two reasons, we think that the remedy that Congress created here is -- is sufficient to displace 1983. The first is that it is an extensive system of remedies that include enforcement mechanisms by the Secretary himself.  So the states administer FNHRA in the sense that they provide surveyors who go out to each facility each year to make sure that the -- the  facilities are in compliance with FNHRA. But there is also an additional process by which the Secretary can impose sanctions on each facility.  They can impose civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day per violation. They can cut off further Medicaid funding at the facility.  They can require the installation of new management at the facility. And they can even order the facility to close. So we think those administrative mechanisms by the Secretary are significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "222   So I was going to go back to the other thing that I think is significant here and why we think this administrative enforcement mechanism is sufficient. We think that ordinarily -- Justice Kagan, you were getting at this -- ordinarily, when you have a system in which all of the regulated parties are state actors, and Congress creates an administrative enforcement mechanism, it would be unclear whether Congress intended that administrative mechanism to be exclusive or if, instead, Congress just assumed that Section 1983 would provide a background default rule that would also allow private suits. What's different about this case is  that Congress was acting in an area where a substantial number of the participants are private parties, and Congress contemplated providing a private cause of action against those private parties but left that out of the ultimate bill it enacted. And so we know that Congress believed that the administrative enforcement mechanism it was creating was sufficient for the 90 percent of nursing home residents who -- who live in privately operated -- operated facilities, and we think that's a very strong indication that it -- it didn't believe that a private cause of action --JUSTICE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "244   So -- so, to the extent that the Court was talking about the dividing line between those cases in which it's actually   found Section 1983 displaced and the cases where it hasn't, I think just descriptively the line is the availability of private judicial remedies. In each of those three cases, there was a private judicial remedy. Now, in cases where this Court has found that Section 1983 was not displaced, the Court has emphasized the lack of either a judicial or an administrative mechanism. And so we think the fact that the Court has asked about the availability of an administrative mechanism suggests that in some cases that could be sufficient, and we think that it's sufficient here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "255   I don't want to suggest that that's an incredibly clear line-drawing problem or line.  The -- the thing that we are getting at is whether Congress would have assumed that Section 1983 was providing a -- a backstop in most of the cases. And, here, Congress wouldn't have done  that because Congress knew that for a significant number of the cases where it was creating rights, there would be no private cause of action.  And so it must have concluded that the administrative mechanism it was establishing in FNHRA itself was comprehensive and sufficient at the federal level to protect those rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "259   So a couple of things on that. One is that within the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created, it did address this concern about sort of -- I -- I think the negative characterization would be the state regulating state entities.  And in that context, Congress said that the Secretary would have responsibility for certifying state facilities and gave the Secretary the ability to impose enforcement remedies at state-operated facilities.  So we think that Congress accounted for it in that way. You mentioned that Congress said expressly no in the statute, and I think you were referring to (h)(8), so I wanted to wanted to address that provision.  We -- we understand  that provision to operate in the same way as the provisions that this Court addressed in Sea Clammers and Rancho Palos Verdes.  Congress, in that provision, was attempting to ensure that rights that -- that residents already had independently of FNHRA would not somehow be eliminated through the adoption of FNHRA. It spoke specifically to -- sorry. I'm looking at the language.  The -- it shouldn't be construed as limiting -- sorry --that the remedies it was creating were in addition to those otherwise available under state or federal law. We think that that \"otherwise available\" means rights that -- rights and remedies that the residents would have had without the adoption of FNHRA. We don't think that was speaking one way or the other to whether Congress intended for FNHRA to allow residents to bring new Section 1983 suits they hadn't been able to bring before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "261   So, Justice Sotomayor, we -- we just draw a difference in -- a different inference from the way Congress structured the statute.  We also think, to -- to get to the point of the tension between the administrative enforcement mechanism that Congress created and Section 1983 remedies, that Congress specifically directed the ways in which money collected through civil penalties are be -- are to be spent, for example, and focused that on the -- the welfare of residents more broadly, as opposed to just going to an individual resident whose rights had been wronged. And so allowing Section 1983 suits that would sort of bypass that administrative enforcement mechanism and lead to funds being taken out of the nursing home system would be inconsistent with that congressional choice. I do want to take a moment -- I haven't gotten any questions on the first question presented, but I do want to bring up  the 1994 statutes, which, to the extent that there is any doubt about whether Thiboutot was correctly decided, we think that the two legislative ratifications that Congress adopted in 1994 put that to rest. In those statutes, Congress wrote that \"in an action brought to enforce a provision of the Social Security Act, such provision is not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of the Act requiring a state plan.\" I don't think there's any way to read that legislative text other than as embracing a -- a congressional expectation that at least some of the provisions of the Social Security Act would be enforceable under Section 1983. My friend's approach on the first question presented would say that no provisions of the Social Security Act can ever be enforced under Section 1983.  We think that was wrong as an original matter, but we also don't think that it can be reconciled with those 1994 statutes. With that, I'm happy to rest on our brief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

And Justice Ginsburg asked at argument about this same sort of problem, that it would be kind of strange to say that Section 1983 is available to enforce rights against public schools but not private schools that are subject to the same requirements.

       "271   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The difference between our position and the United States's position in this case is unbelievably narrow.  The United States agrees that this Court should not overrule decades of precedent holding that rights secured by Spending Clause laws are enforceable under Section 1983.  And the United States agrees that FNHRA creates two enforceable rights.  And we are obviously right about those points. The only point of departure is that the United States believes that Congress showed a clear intention to preclude access to 1983 by   extending FNHRA rights to residents of private nursing homes, even though they're not able to use 1983 to enforce those rights because 1983 only permits suits against government actors. That gets the statute backwards. FNHRA's text and context show that when Congress enacted the statute in 1987, it wanted to preserve access to all available remedies for FNHRA violations to the greatest extent possible. Thus, as no one disputes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of nursing home residents to sue to enforce their FNHRA rights in private lawsuits under state tort law.  And, as the United States concedes, Congress expressly preserved the ability of the Attorney General to enforce these rights under CRIPA, which is just Section 1983 for the Attorney General. We think it is equally clear that Congress wanted to preserve access to Section 1983 for two reasons.  First, the statute says it.  The statute's Savings Clause, on Joint Appendix 123, means what it says. The Savings Clause says that other remedies will  also be available to enforce FNHRA. The legislative history confirms that that is the correct reading of the text. Second, Congress had good reason to preserve 1983 specifically for residents of government nursing homes.  Congress knew that sovereign immunity often makes it more difficult or impossible to sue government nursing homes. Congress also understood that when states own the nursing homes, FNHRA's scheme, which depends on states to enforce FNHRA's requirements, falls apart. And Congress enacted FNHRA against a background of numerous laws, like CRIPA, RLUIPA, RFRA, and Section 1983 itself, that specifically hold governments to a higher standard to protect rights than private institutions. Finally, I would also like to reiterate that, even aside from all of the above, the actual standard in this Court's cases for finding implied preclusion is exceptionally high. It requires incompatibility between the remedies in the statute and Section 1983.  There is no incompatibility here. I welcome the Court's questions.   \n",
       "285   Your Honor, we don't know, for instance, whether, even though 10 percent of nursing homes were public, whether the worst nursing homes were those 10 percent. We don't know anything about what Congress knew, in fact, about the state of play in the nursing home industry. We don't know if Congress expected that in 10 years' time it would be flipped around and would be 10 percent private and 90 percent public. And it actually cashes out in this case because Indiana has made more than 90 percent of its nursing homes public.  So it is the exact flip reverse of the rest of the nation. And for the individuals in those nursing homes who confront very draconian limitations on their ability to actually enforce these rights under state law, against state-run nursing facilities, it is really Section 1983 that is filling the gap and making those rights real for those people. Congress doesn't create rights with the expectation that, generally, with the  expectation that someone else will come in and enforce those rights on your behalf. The way that the Solicitor General thinks this scheme should work and -- and HHC is that you are given rights. You are told of these rights orally and in writing on admission to the nursing home. They say you have the right to be free from restraints.  And your family reads this and then, if you -- you don't actually have any rights to enforce.

So, I mean, this family was crying out for help and using every possible lever at their disposal.  Section 1983 was the last resort.

And then it fits in with Section 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "309   I -- I don't think so, and I'll give you a few answers.  The -- the most important is that 1983 refers to new -- new statutes.  You know, Justice Scalia in Blessing talked about the fact that new rights created in new statutes would still be presumptively enforceable under Section 1983.  No one would dispute that.  And we take the statute for what the words meant at the time, not necessarily for the scope of rights that would be protected. But, even if you disagree with all of that, these are actually the kinds of rights  that Section 1983 was enacted to protect, rights to bodily integrity and autonomy, fundamental rights, you know, if you map this onto the rights protected by the Constitution. So, if you're asking if this kind of tort would be the kind of right that you could enforce, I think the answer is an emphatic yes. If you're -- if you're asking about contract law, I don't think that the contract law analogy makes sense for numerous reasons.  Most obviously, Spending Clause legislation like this didn't exist, and the -- and the kind of analogy to Spending Clause legislation didn't emerge until the 20th Century.  So there's just no reliable way to even know that Congress would have thought that by using the spending power, as opposed to its commerce power, when enacting a rights-creating statute, it was making a fundamentally different decision with respect to its ratification of 1983.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "317   Well, Your Honor, I would just go back to Pennhurst, which really started this -- this off, and it applied the contract analogy but said that the rights are part of the contract.

       "      <td>We'll hear argument next in 21-1270, MOAC Mall Holdings versus Transform Holdco LLC. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS H. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Because of the harsh consequences of designating a procedural prerequisite jurisdictional, this Court requires a clear indication from Congress before it will treat a limit as such. Nothing in the text, structure, or context of Section 363(m) suggests, much less clearly reflects, that Congress intended the absence of a stay to deprive the appellate courts of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the text explicitly presupposes the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, including to reverse or modify a sale order.  The provision merely limits the remedial consequences of such a ruling and then only if there was no stay.             Transform's few appellate decisions concerning an earlier rule of bankruptcy procedure do not provide a clear indication of jurisdictional character.  None of the cases Transform cites are from this Court, and none actually designated the rule jurisdictional. Because the requirement of a stay is not jurisdictional, it was subject to waiver, forfeiture, and estoppel, each of which applies here. Transform assured the bankruptcy court that it would not invoke Section 363(b) to defeat MOAC's appeal because Transform did not believe Section 363(m) applied.  And Transform was right.  The order under review did not authorize a sale under 363(b).  The asset sale had already closed.  Rather, the order authorized assumption and assignment of a lease under Section 365, with no additional payment to the debtor. It does not defeat any congressional limit on the Court's power to hold Transform to the position it took in the bankruptcy court. Finally, Transform's alternative argument that the lease's transfer deprived the   appellate courts of jurisdiction to review the assignment order is confused on multiple levels. It wrongly assumes that bankruptcy courts' jurisdiction is solely in rem, which this Court has rejected, but even if it were, this Court has made clear that the transfer of the res does not deprive the appellate courts of jurisdiction where, as here, the transferee is a party to the proceedings. I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

Respondent is incorrect in asserting that Section 363(m) is nonetheless jurisdictional because it reflects a longstanding limit on in rem jurisdiction. Among other things, this Court's decision in Republic National Bank rejected the existence of the very limit on in rem jurisdiction that Respondent now asserts. Nor should Respondent prevail based on its new argument that Section 549 and 550 provide the exclusive means to unwind the disputed lease assignment.  This new argument about whether Petitioner is entitled to relief under the bankruptcy statutes is not jurisdictional, and even if it were, there is no reason that this Court would have to address it before the question of subject matter jurisdiction on which this Court granted cert.

       "      <td>Justice Jackson, there is that point that goes to 363(m). My argument initially is wholly apart from Section 363(m). Put that statute aside, put the question of waiver aside because it only pertains to Section 363(m). There is no case or controversy. There is no way to undo the sale in this instance.  And here is why, three reasons:  The remedy they seek, which is specified on page 10 of their brief, the courts can simply enter an order voiding transfer of MOAC's lease.  You can just simply take the property from them. That remedy does not exist as a matter of law.  The statutory remedy, the exclusive remedy is the avoidance powers.  That's not available here.  The bankruptcy court on remand has no subject matter jurisdiction over this property.  Its property is -- its jurisdiction is limited to property of the estate. This is not property of the estate. If this were remanded back to the bankruptcy  judge, the judge would say, I don't have jurisdiction here.  I have jurisdiction over property of the estate, not Transform's property.  If you want me to have jurisdiction, you have to invoke the avoidance powers to bring it back into the estate.  That's not available. But, Justice Gorsuch, your question about what is the -- what is the answer, it is in this Court's seminal decisions, so for commercial law geeks like me, these decisions, although not widely known, they are seminal in my field, and they are this -- this -- this Court's triumvirate of decisions in Gray versus Brignardello, in Voorhees versus Bank of the United States, and in Grignon's Lessee versus Astor, and there the Court unequivocally explained, if you reverse a sale order on appeal, it does nothing to affect the sale.  The sale cannot be overturned. This Court's language explanation in Gray is -- is -- is -- is -- is straightforward. Although the judgment or decree may be reversed, yet all rights acquired at a judicial sale while the decree or judgment were in full force and which they authorized will be protected.  With the errors of the Court, the purchaser has no concern and the Court said this is so well established, you know, we don't -- we shouldn't even have to reiterate it.  The Court was even more unequivocal in Voorhees versus Bank of the United States.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, two -- several things, Justice Sotomayor.  First of all, it was a two step-process for the sale. The sale was under Section 363 of the assets, which required further approval of the Court for the transfer of the lease, which is also part of the sale, for which additional consideration was paid in addition to the 1.4 billion that was paid for the bulk sale. So this was all a package together. What happened, though, was, at that point, right, and -- and this is -- this is --this is important, the bankruptcy court does not exercise in personam jurisdiction over property of the estate.  There's no summons and complaint against the purchaser.  There's no ordinary in personam process.  It's all in rem. This Court said so in Stratton versus New, and as the Seventh Circuit explained, a proceeding under Section 363, that's the sale statute, is an in rem proceeding.  One does not convert an in rem proceeding into in personam as a buyer by -- by showing up. If that were true, this Court's decision in Hood would be wrong.

They cited in their papers in the bankruptcy court the very jurisdictional precedents from the Second Circuit that say it's jurisdictional.  One also  cannot by consent or waiver or misstatement of the law create subject matter jurisdiction that does not exist. Here, there is no subject matter jurisdiction because the statute bluntly says, no matter what you do on appeal, you cannot bring the asset back into the estate.  If you cannot bring the asset back into the estate, it's not property of the estate. There cannot be federal subject matter jurisdiction in bankruptcy, which is limited in rem to assets of the estate.  Okay.  So it is a blunt jurisdictional abrogation. That is by design.  That was specifically what Congress intended by codifying verbatim in this oddly worded statute a former rule of procedure, Rule 805, which was declaratory of existing law. The two seminal cases were Fink and Taylor.  Taylor involved a situation where there were assets in bankruptcy that were sold, and then the Committee of Creditors appealed and the court of appeals said we don't have jurisdiction to decide this controversy.  We have no authority to hear.  The same thing in Fink, which used jurisdiction three times in its decision, the Fourth Circuit's decision.  Jurisdiction, jurisdiction, jurisdiction.  We cannot bring the property back.  We cannot order it to come back. Again, one does not --CHIEF</td>\n",

If, in fact, the sale were overturned because it was a bad faith purchaser, then there are ways, statutory means of undoing the sale and bringing the property back into the estate so the court can exercise in rem jurisdiction over it. But the statutory scheme is holistic. Section 363(m) suspends all of that if it's to a good faith purchaser by bluntly stating nothing that you can do can bring the asset back. Overturning it, reversing it, modifying it does not affect the validity of the sale.  The transfer of ownership must remain in the purchaser.  All of those ancillary processes to bring the race back into the estate, into the custody of the bankruptcy court so it can order an alternative disposition, are suspended.

Nothing in the text, structure, or context of Section 363(m) suggests, much less clearly reflects, that Congress intended the absence of a stay to deprive the appellate courts of jurisdiction.  To the contrary, the text explicitly presupposes the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, including to reverse or modify a sale order.  The provision merely limits the remedial consequences of such a ruling and then only if there was no stay.             Transform's few appellate decisions concerning an earlier rule of bankruptcy procedure do not provide a clear indication of jurisdictional character.  None of the cases Transform cites are from this Court, and none actually designated the rule jurisdictional. Because the requirement of a stay is not jurisdictional, it was subject to waiver, forfeiture, and estoppel, each of which applies here. Transform assured the bankruptcy court that it would not invoke Section 363(b) to defeat MOAC's appeal because Transform did not believe Section 363(m) applied.  And Transform was right.  The order under review did not authorize a sale under 363(b).  The asset sale had already closed.  Rather, the order authorized assumption and assignment of a lease under Section 365, with no additional payment to the debtor. It does not defeat any congressional limit on the Court's power to hold Transform to the position it took in the bankruptcy court. Finally, Transform's alternative argument that the lease's transfer deprived the   appellate courts of jurisdiction to review the assignment order is confused on multiple levels. It wrongly assumes that bankruptcy courts' jurisdiction is solely in rem, which this Court has rejected, but even if it were, this Court has made clear that the transfer of the res does not deprive the appellate courts of jurisdiction where, as here, the transferee is a party to the proceedings. I welcome the Court's questions.   \n",
       "51    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 363(m) is not jurisdictional  because nothing in its text suggests that it is, and there is no other evidence that satisfies the clear statement rule described in Arbaugh. Respondent is incorrect in asserting that Section 363(m) is nonetheless jurisdictional because it reflects a longstanding limit on in rem jurisdiction. Among other things, this Court's decision in Republic National Bank rejected the existence of the very limit on in rem jurisdiction that Respondent now asserts. Nor should Respondent prevail based on its new argument that Section 549 and 550 provide the exclusive means to unwind the disputed lease assignment.  This new argument about whether Petitioner is entitled to relief under the bankruptcy statutes is not jurisdictional, and even if it were, there is no reason that this Court would have to address it before the question of subject matter jurisdiction on which this Court granted cert. I welcome the Court's questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "81     Justice Jackson, there is that point that goes to 363(m). My argument initially is wholly apart from Section 363(m). Put that statute aside, put the question of waiver aside because it only pertains to Section 363(m). There is no case or controversy. There is no way to undo the sale in this instance.  And here is why, three reasons:  The remedy they seek, which is specified on page 10 of their brief, the courts can simply enter an order voiding transfer of MOAC's lease.  You can just simply take the property from them. That remedy does not exist as a matter of law.  The statutory remedy, the exclusive remedy is the avoidance powers.  That's not available here.  The bankruptcy court on remand has no subject matter jurisdiction over this property.  Its property is -- its jurisdiction is limited to property of the estate. This is not property of the estate. If this were remanded back to the bankruptcy  judge, the judge would say, I don't have jurisdiction here.  I have jurisdiction over property of the estate, not Transform's property.  If you want me to have jurisdiction, you have to invoke the avoidance powers to bring it back into the estate.  That's not available. But, Justice Gorsuch, your question about what is the -- what is the answer, it is in this Court's seminal decisions, so for commercial law geeks like me, these decisions, although not widely known, they are seminal in my field, and they are this -- this -- this Court's triumvirate of decisions in Gray versus Brignardello, in Voorhees versus Bank of the United States, and in Grignon's Lessee versus Astor, and there the Court unequivocally explained, if you reverse a sale order on appeal, it does nothing to affect the sale.  The sale cannot be overturned. This Court's language explanation in Gray is -- is -- is -- is -- is straightforward. Although the judgment or decree may be reversed, yet all rights acquired at a judicial sale while the decree or judgment were in full force and which they authorized will be protected.  With the errors of the Court, the purchaser has no concern and the Court said this is so well established, you know, we don't -- we shouldn't even have to reiterate it.  The Court was even more unequivocal in Voorhees versus Bank of the United States.                                                                        \n",
       "95     Well, two -- several things, Justice Sotomayor.  First of all, it was a two step-process for the sale. The sale was under Section 363 of the assets, which required further approval of the Court for the transfer of the lease, which is also part of the sale, for which additional consideration was paid in addition to the 1.4 billion that was paid for the bulk sale. So this was all a package together. What happened, though, was, at that point, right, and -- and this is -- this is --this is important, the bankruptcy court does not exercise in personam jurisdiction over property of the estate.  There's no summons and complaint against the purchaser.  There's no ordinary in personam process.  It's all in rem. This Court said so in Stratton versus New, and as the Seventh Circuit explained, a proceeding under Section 363, that's the sale statute, is an in rem proceeding.  One does not convert an in rem proceeding into in personam as a buyer by -- by showing up. If that were true, this Court's decision in Hood would be wrong.

       "174    Counsel for Transform. It's the same mistake the bankruptcy judge made about Section 363.  But Transform knew this was a jurisdictional question.  They cited in their papers in the bankruptcy court the very jurisdictional precedents from the Second Circuit that say it's jurisdictional.  One also  cannot by consent or waiver or misstatement of the law create subject matter jurisdiction that does not exist. Here, there is no subject matter jurisdiction because the statute bluntly says, no matter what you do on appeal, you cannot bring the asset back into the estate.  If you cannot bring the asset back into the estate, it's not property of the estate. There cannot be federal subject matter jurisdiction in bankruptcy, which is limited in rem to assets of the estate.  Okay.  So it is a blunt jurisdictional abrogation. That is by design.  That was specifically what Congress intended by codifying verbatim in this oddly worded statute a former rule of procedure, Rule 805, which was declaratory of existing law. The two seminal cases were Fink and Taylor.  Taylor involved a situation where there were assets in bankruptcy that were sold, and then the Committee of Creditors appealed and the court of appeals said we don't have jurisdiction to decide this controversy.  We have no authority to hear.  The same thing in Fink, which used jurisdiction three times in its decision, the Fourth Circuit's decision.  Jurisdiction, jurisdiction, jurisdiction.  We cannot bring the property back.  We cannot order it to come back.

       "194    Yes, Justice Barrett, and there is a remedy.  As this Court explained in Katz, the avoidance powers are ancillary to  the court's in rem jurisdiction. If, in fact, the sale were overturned because it was a bad faith purchaser, then there are ways, statutory means of undoing the sale and bringing the property back into the estate so the court can exercise in rem jurisdiction over it. But the statutory scheme is holistic. Section 363(m) suspends all of that if it's to a good faith purchaser by bluntly stating nothing that you can do can bring the asset back. Overturning it, reversing it, modifying it does not affect the validity of the sale.  The transfer of ownership must remain in the purchaser.  All of those ancillary processes to bring the race back into the estate, into the custody of the bankruptcy court so it can order an alternative disposition, are suspended. That's the -- that was the intended effect of Section 363(m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

But the context is really critical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "249    Well, there's jurisdiction for that because the statute only abrogates subject matter jurisdiction if you've got a good faith purchaser. It goes to defining -- it's like saying suppose the federal question statute said you have federal subject matter jurisdiction over federal questions except for X. Well, you would have to determine as a factual matter, is this about X? If it's about X, we don't have jurisdiction.  If it's not about X, we do. That's exactly the same thing that's going on here under Section 363(m).  Is it a good faith purchaser?  That's a factual question.  If it's a good faith purchaser, the abrogation of jurisdiction applies. If it's not a good faith purchaser, it doesn't. And if it's not a good faith purchaser, we have a whole remedial scheme under the Bankruptcy Code that can get invoked.  But, if it is a good faith purchaser, you cannot touch the sale.  It cannot be undone. That was by design.  That was Congress's intent to do that in codifying this   historic practice.  And when codify -- when Congress codifies an historic rule, especially in bankruptcy, this Court has said over and over again --JUSTICE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
